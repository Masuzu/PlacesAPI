The site of the first stall is marked with a green and gold commemorative clock in Leeds Kirkgate Market. One of the original Penny Bazaars - in the Grainger Market, Newcastle upon Tyne - remains open to this day, and is now the smallest Marks & Spencer store in operation.[2]\n\nMarks' first full store was opened in 1894 at Stretford Road, Hulme, in Manchester. Marks entered into a partnership with Thomas Spencer who was working as Dewhirst cashier. Dewhirst went into manufacturing and remains the biggest supplier to M&S. The official first Marks and Spencer store opened in 1904. Then when founders Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer passed away, the title of Chairman went to Marks’ son Simon Marks. Simon Marks started to work with his friend Israel Sieff and thanks to their joint efforts, Marks and Spencer grew to become a household name. Marks and Spencer became a Limited Company after adopting the revolutionary policy of buying directly from manufacturers. In 1926 the company then started selling textiles and in 1928 the St Michael Trade Mark was registered. In 1930 M&S opened a flagship store at Marble Arch, London. Then Café Bars were introduced in many stores. These provided cheap, hygienic and nutritious mass catering. This was a valuable resource during the war, making efficient use of scarce food. In 1931, a food department was introduced selling produce and canned goods. By 1956, all goods were sold under the St Michael label. In 1964, Simon Marks died after 56 years' service to the Company, and Israel Sieff took over as Chairman. In 1974, Asian food was introduced into the stores. M&S opened up stores in continental Europe in 1975, then four years later in Ireland. By 1999, Online Shopping was brought in, and the company grew with new sales of fashion clothing.\n\n\nFamous for not having changing rooms to increase floor display space, hence returns allowed, and for having many sizes and colours for each design of skirt, dress and trousers.\n\n\n\nFor women;\n\nShop by Category\nAccessories \nCoats & Jackets \nDresses \nHandbags & Purses \nJewellery & Watches \nKnitwear\nSarongs  \nShirts & Blouses \nShoes \nSkirts \nSlippers \nSports & Leisurewear \nSuits & Tailoring \nSwimwear \nTops & T-Shirts \nTrousers & Jeans \n\nBras \nBras DD+ \nCamisoles & Vests \nHosiery & Socks \nKnickers \nNightwear & Slippers \nNursing & Maternity \nShapewear \nSlips \nThermal & Warmwear \n\nKnee Highs & Ankle Highs \nLadder Resist Hosiery \nShoe Solutions \nSocks \nStockings & Hold Ups \nTights"},{"id":662738,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/662738/Park-Plaza-Westminster-Bridge\">Park Plaza Westminster Bridge</a>","title":"Park Plaza Westminster Bridge","tags":[{"id":50,"title":"hotel"},{"id":3021,"title":"high-rise"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1169151,"y":51.5011777},{"x":-0.1170304,"y":51.5011594},{"x":-0.1170975,"y":51.501131},{"x":-0.1171431,"y":51.5010976},{"x":-0.117186,"y":51.5010325},{"x":-0.1171967,"y":51.5009657},{"x":-0.1171994,"y":51.5008338},{"x":-0.1171216,"y":51.500615},{"x":-0.1170921,"y":51.5005717},{"x":-0.1170465,"y":51.5005249},{"x":-0.1170063,"y":51.5005007},{"x":-0.116954,"y":51.5004807},{"x":-0.116899,"y":51.5004657},{"x":-0.1168427,"y":51.5004598},{"x":-0.116789,"y":51.5004615},{"x":-0.1167166,"y":51.500474},{"x":-0.1165959,"y":51.5005116},{"x":-0.1164256,"y":51.5005834},{"x":-0.1163116,"y":51.5006351},{"x":-0.1162217,"y":51.5006852},{"x":-0.1161574,"y":51.5007311},{"x":-0.1161051,"y":51.5007796},{"x":-0.1160823,"y":51.5008079},{"x":-0.1160729,"y":51.5008355},{"x":-0.1160689,"y":51.5008664},{"x":-0.1160782,"y":51.5009073},{"x":-0.1161064,"y":51.5009457},{"x":-0.1161413,"y":51.5009766},{"x":-0.1162231,"y":51.5010192},{"x":-0.116317,"y":51.5010576},{"x":-0.1163947,"y":51.5010843},{"x":-0.1165476,"y":51.5011277},{"x":-0.1166455,"y":51.5011494},{"x":-0.1167569,"y":51.5011694}],"location":{"lon":-0.1166342,"lat":51.5008187,"north":51.5011777,"south":51.5004598,"east":-0.1160689,"west":-0.1171994,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"The Park Plaza Westminster Bridge is a hotel located in Lambeth, London.

The hotel was designed for guests who wished to stay in London for periods of time, rather than simply passing through, and apartments were let by the month, rather than by the night.\n\nThis was a successful venture and by 1817 he had acquired a second house to use as an annexe, at 57 Brook Street. This was the house that stood on the corner of Brook Street and Davies Street. \n\nFive Consecutive Houses\nBy 1838, Mivart owned a row of five consecutive houses, knocking through to create one large hotel. The Great Exhibition of 1851 brought a great influx of visitors to London, and foreign royalty including the Grand Duke Alexander of Russia and King William III of the Netherlands made Mivart’s their home from home.\n\nThe Claridge’s\nNo. 49 Brook Street had always been a separate hotel, run by husband and wife William and Marianne Claridge. In 1854 they purchased Mivart’s; Mivart, now in his 70s, was able to retire, and the Claridges owned the entire row of houses from no. 49 to the corner of the block. The goodwill associated with the Mivart name was such that the hotel initially traded as “Claridge’s, late Mivart’s” until Mivart’s death in 1856. \n\nClaridge’s, as the hotel would now be known, continued to attract the best of British and foreign aristocracy. Perhaps its greatest seal of approval came when Queen Victoria arrived with Prince Albert to visit the Empress Eugènie of France, who had made Claridge’s her winter quarters in 1860. \n\nA Difficult Decade\nBy 1881 William Claridge was in poor health and reluctantly he and his wife sold the hotel to a consortium who lacked the personal touch. \n\nMore attractive hotels were being built in London at this time, offering such luxuries as electricity, lifts to all floors and en suite bathrooms. It was difficult to upgrade and Claridge’s suffered by comparison. \n\nA New Beginning\nThe company which owned Claridge’s proposed the building of a new hotel on the site but by the early 1890s there was simply not enough money to make such an idea viable. In 1893 Richard D’Oyly Carte stepped into the picture. \n\nD’Oyly Carte had already built The Savoy and realised the potential of Claridge’s immediately, and negotiated successfully to purchase the hotel from the consortium. Claridge’s became his second hotel in 1894, and was promptly closed down and completely demolished.\n\nThe New Claridge’s\nA brand-new purpose-built hotel designed by C.W. Stephens was then erected on the site over the next four years, and Claridge’s reopened in November 1898.\n\nThe idea of offering apartments for long-term residents was retained but this was combined with the same modern technology and comforts – electricity, lifts and en-suite bathrooms – that had been such a success at The Savoy. The result was that Claridge’s retained its exclusive clientele, and remained popular particularly with visiting European royalty.\n\nThe First World War\nClaridge’s was now a very successful hotel. It came into its own after the First World War, when many aristocrats were forced to sell their London houses. Keeping a house in London which one might only use for six months of the year had been very expensive. Renting a suite at the London Season was a great deal cheaper as the hiring and keeping of staff was no longer an issue. \n\nA Favourite Society Venue\nClaridge’s became a favourite society venue, and parts were redecorated by Basil Ionides in the mid-1920s to reflect the fashion for art deco that was starting to become popular. \n\nAt about the same time, the Duke of Westminster offered to sell the freehold of the site. The two houses were demolished and a new block was erected next to Stephen’s “original” Claridge’s. \n\nDuring The Second World War\nClaridge’s was fortunate to escape war-time bombing, and remained a popular social centre. The Grill Room with its separate entrance on Davies Street became Claridge’s Causerie in the early 1940s. \n\nThe Causerie, designed by Sir Howard Robertson, served smörgåsbord, and the twist was that clients could eat as much of this as they liked, while only paying for their drinks. This would have been a novelty at any time but was a brave and successful attempt to make rationing seem a little less depressing. \n\nRoyal Exile\nMany royal families who found themselves exiled from their own countries as war raged across Europe made their way to the familiar haven that was Claridge’s. Notable among them was King Peter of Yugoslavia, exiled from his country in 1941 and his son, Crown Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia was born in Suite 212 in July 1945. \n\nPrime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill declared the suite Yugoslav territory, and legend has it that a spadeful of Yugoslav earth was placed under the bed so that the heir to the throne could literally be born on Yugoslav soil. \n\nVisiting Statesmen\nAfter the War State delegations from all over the world stayed at Claridge’s, and many of these would be invited to attend a banquet in their honour at Buckingham Palace. Eventually it became traditional for visiting statesmen to return hospitality by hosting a banquet for H.M the Queen at Claridge’s, and the hotel staff were more than equal to the occasion. \n\nAs a result of this, the Royal Family became familiar with Claridge’s standards of hospitality and service, and chose to host many of their own private family parties at the hotel. \n\nThe Art Deco Jewel\nIn 1996 Claridge’s embarked on the first major designer restoration since the 1930s, when David Collins was invited to create a new cocktail bar. New York-based designer Thierry Despont was brought in to revitalise the Foyer area. Using archive photographs of the Ballroom Extension that dated from the early 1930s as inspiration, the space was completely made over in a modern art deco style, with a stunning, and completely up-to-the minute Dale Chihuly chandelier as its centrepiece. \n\nA dramatic and notable way for Claridge’s to enter the 21st Century, Thierry Despont went on to create Gordon Ramsay at Claridge’s which has one Michelin star now.\n\nhttp://www.claridges.co.uk/"},{"id":1844175,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1844175/Royal-College-of-Surgeons-of-England\">Royal College of Surgeons of England</a>","title":"Royal College of Surgeons of England","tags":[{"id":127,"title":"museum"},{"id":50361,"title":"medical organisation"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_College_of_Surgeons_of_England","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1165661,"y":51.5152643},{"x":-0.1163462,"y":51.5149004},{"x":-0.1151419,"y":51.5152326},{"x":-0.1153511,"y":51.5155447}],"location":{"lon":-0.115854,"lat":51.5152225,"north":51.5155447,"south":51.5149004,"east":-0.1151419,"west":-0.1165661,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Dating back to 1540 and the foundation by Henry VIII of the Company of Barber-Surgeons, the Royal College is responsible for running surgical examinations and providing top quality education.

Liberty. Famous for prints and fabric designs. \n\nThe mock-Tudor building on Great Marlborough Street contains the store, while the neoclassical building on Regent Street has shops, including The Gap, on the ground floor and Liberty corporate offices above.\n\nLiberty is a well known store in Regent Street in central London, England at the heart of the West End shopping district. It was founded by Arthur Lasenby Liberty in 1875 to sell ornaments, fabrics and miscellaneous art objects from Japan and the Far East.\n\nLiberty & Co. first catered for an eclectic mixture of popular styles, but then went on to develop a fundamentally different style closely linked to the aesthetic movement of the 1890s and Art Nouveau. The company became synonymous with this new style to the extent that in Italy, Art Nouveau became known as Stile Liberty after the London shop.\n\nLiberty still has a distinctive style and produces some of its own fabrics. Its building is composed of two wings. The older wing fronts Great Marlborough Street and is one of the most prominent Tudor revival Arts and Crafts buildings in London. It is a Grade II* listed building. The timbers used in the construction of the building (built in 1924) were taken from two british naval ships, the HMS Impregnable and HMS Hindustan.[1] The Regent Street wing is early 20th century neo-Baroque, like most of the rest of Regent Street. This part is Grade II listed. These days the shop sells up to date fashions, cosmetics, accessories, gifts etc. in addition to its homewares and furniture. The shop is noted for not feeling like a typical large department store, as it is small and intimate with stairs and decorative elevators instead of escalators and is spread out around several wooden balconied, \"mock-Tudor\" style atriums with glass roofs over, which are decorated with thousands of tiny lights at Christmas.\n\nhttp://www.liberty.co.uk/"},{"id":23626140,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

It is situated at the park's southwest corner, near Baker Street, between York Terrace and Clarence Terrace, within the park's Crown Estate development. Cornwall Terrace was part of the scheme of the Prince Regent, later King George IV, to develop grand housing in Regent's Park. \nCornwall Terrace was one of the earliest buildings constructed in Regency Park, and the park's first completed terrace. Construction occurred between 1821 and 1823 by the builder and developer, James Burton. The design was by his son, Decimus Burton, though Sir John Nash was responsible for the main lines, Greco-Roman in style, and supervised construction. After the Second World War, the terrace was refurbished.\n\nhttp://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-209329-1-21-cornwall-terrace-nw1-greater-london\n\n( This photo is distributed under the terms of the Wikimedia Commons Free Documentation License.

It is mentioned repeatedly in the literature of the time, and specifically included in the poems' of TS Elliott about Cats.\n\nThe architect of this remarkable structure, Charles Fitzroy Doll is said to have based his design for the façade on the Chateau de Madrid in the Bois de Boulogne. Externally the hotel is a typically creative showcase of Victorian histrionics, apart from the design of the facades the Russell also incorporates several decorative sculptural elements. A frieze of shields, originally coloured, representing the \"Coats of Arms of many Nations\" adorn the front of the hotel, and were designed by W.J Neatby (1860-1910).\n\nDoll also engaged his favourite sculptor Henry Charles Fehr (1867-1940) to model the four life-size statues of British Queens, who look down from above the main front entrance. In addition four busts of British Prime Ministers adorn the Guilford street side of the building.\n\nBoasting one of the capital's most prestigious locations, the 373 bedroom Hotel Russell is situated in the heart of Bloomsbury, in the centre of London. The peaceful and tranquil greenery of Russell Square itself, located opposite the hotel, provides delightful respite from the hustle and bustle of Western Europe's busiest capital, and Russell Square's Underground station is immediately adjacent providing easy access to all of London.\n\nThe Hotel dominates the East Side of Russell Square, and is a spectacular example of late Victorian Renaissance Revival architecture. Built between 1896 and 1900 and smothered in terracotta ornament, the hotel rises through eight exuberant storeys and originally had a French Mansard roof covered in intricate green fishscale tiles.\n\nFollowing a £20 million refurbishment, the Hotel Russell has been completely transformed to provide luxury hotel accommodation and modern meeting rooms behind its original imposing Victorian facade.\n\nIdeally located for all of the major attractions of London and for the financial and commercial districts, a stay at the Hotel Russell is a must when visiting the capital.

It was built between 1751-1753 by John Vardy to a design by William Kent. The building was constructed on the site of the Guard House of the old Whitehall Palace, which had been destroyed by fire in 1698. \n\nThe building was the headquarters of the British Army's general staff and served as the offices of the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army until the post was abolished in 1904. Horse Guards subsequently became the headquarters of two major Army commands: the London District and the Household Cavalry. \n\nThe building is the formal entrance to St. James's Palace via St. James's Park (though this is now entirely symbolic). Only the monarch is allowed to drive through its central archway, or those given a pass (formerly made of ivory).\n\nHorse Guards is always guarded by troopers of the Household Cavalry, both mounted and on foot; visiting the horses is popular with tourists. Two mounted cavalry troopers are posted outside daily from 10 am to 4 pm, and are relieved every hour. There are usually guided tours of the building on London Open House weekend, which takes place in September.\n\nConstruction start: 1745\nConstruction finish: 1755\nDesigned by: William Kent and John Vardy\n\nhttp://www.smoothhound.co.uk/tourism/london/horse-guards.html\nhttp://www.londonarchitecture.co.uk/Building/1719/Horse-Guards.php"},{"id":2572996,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a
