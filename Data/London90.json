It was built behind Haymarket Opera House, now the site of Her Majesty's Theatre, where the Phantom of the Opera has been playing for many years. Royal Opera Arcade is a peaceful place in the heart of London, with shops specialising in luxury items, and goods related to country living.\n\nThe Arcade is a covered walk some twelve feet wide, parallel with the Haymarket and extending between Pall Mall and Charles II Street. On its west side are eighteen (originally nineteen) small shops, each with a basement and a mezzanine room. The arcade is likewise composed of eighteen square bays, each ceiled with a simple groined vault rising to a circular skylight, the bays being separated by plain arch-soffits rising from plain-shafted Doric pilasters. Each shop has a display window, quadrant-curved at each end to bring it forward from the wall face, with a simply panelled stallboard, a window divided into large panes by delicately moulded glazing-bars, and a plain fascia below the cornice. The shop door on the right is similarly treated but does not project. In the tympanum above each shop-front is a lunette window, framed with a moulded archivolt and divided into three lights. The wall and ceiling surfaces, and the architectural ornaments, are in stucco, now uniformly painted but originally frescoed to represent Bath stone. There was an arcade of shops leading to the Parthenon however it is no longer standing. The Royal Opera Arcade was completed in 1818, making it undoubtedly London’s oldest shopping arcade. Lord George Cavendish’s Burlington Arcade built in 1818-1819 was completed a year after The Royal Opera Arcade, its planning also followed that of Nash and his ‘tasteful pupil’ George Repton’s Arcade. Indeed, Thomas Leverton and John Fordyce had both promoted the provision of an arcade on the west side of the theatre to improve and complete the ensemble since the latter’s death in 1795 (Survey of London; Vol. XXIX). The arcade is built on the late 18th Century/ early 19th Century model of ‘Passages’ and ‘Galleries’.\n\nThe Arcade has been fortunate to survive devastating fires (1789 and 1867) and a subsequent demolition of the Opera House site (1890) forcing the Theatre to be rebuilt several times and making the arcade of shops the oldest part of the Opera House complex.\nThe Arcade is a covered walk some twelve feet wide, parallel with the Haymarket and extending between Pall Mall and Charles II Street. On its west side are eighteen (originally nineteen) small shops, each with a basement and a mezzanine room. The arcade is likewise composed of eighteen square bays, each ceiled with a simple groined vault rising to a circular skylight, the bays being separated by plain arch-soffits rising from plain-shafted Doric pilasters. Each shop has a display window, quadrant-curved at each end to bring it forward from the wall face, with a simply panelled stallboard, a window divided into large panes by delicately moulded glazing-bars, and a plain fascia below the cornice. The shop door on the right is similarly treated but does not project. In the tympanum above each shop-front is a lunette window, framed with a moulded archivolt and divided into three lights. The wall and ceiling surfaces, and the architectural ornaments, are in stucco, now uniformly painted but originally frescoed to represent Bath stone.\n\nSt James’s and Pall Mall\nPall Mall takes its name from the game ‘palle-maille’, a cross between croquet and golf, that was played here in the early-17th century. For over 150 years this dignified street has been at the heart of London’s clubland. The clubs evolved from the 17th century coffee houses as meeting places where gentlemen could find refuge from their womenfolk. However, most of the exclusive gentlemens’ clubs seen today date from the 19th century.\n\nThe club buildings represent the work of some of the most fashionable architects of the era. The colonnaded United Services Club was built by John Nash in 1827, this was the Duke of Wellington’s favourite club and now houses the Institute of Directors. Facing it, on the other side of Waterloo Place, is the Athenaeum, designed by Decimus Burton in 1830, and has long been the power house of the British establishment.\n\nBeside it are two clubs built by Sir Charles Barry, architect of the Houses of Parliament, the Travellers’ Club and the Reform Club, spawned by the 1832 Reform Act. The RAC club, founded in 1897 is the most recent, and least class-conscious, of the clubs.\n\nhttp://royaloperaarcade.com/index.html"},{"id":18507331,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18507331/Hawkshead\">Hawkshead</a>","title":"Hawkshead","tags":[{"id":44865,"title":"apartment building"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1404861,"y":51.5297786},{"x":-0.1404954,"y":51.5296259},{"x":-0.1400394,"y":51.5296185},{"x":-0.1400435,"y":51.5295367},{"x":-0.140517,"y":51.5295467},{"x":-0.1405196,"y":51.52949},{"x":-0.1406309,"y":51.5294908},{"x":-0.1406148,"y":51.5297803}],"location":{"lon":-0.1403352,"lat":51.5296351,"north":51.5297803,"south":51.52949,"east":-0.1400394,"west":-0.1406309,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":""},{"id":19101767,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/19101767/Henry-VII-Chapel\">Henry VII Chapel</a>","title":"Henry VII Chapel","tags":[{"id":466,"title":"chapel"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_Chapel","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1266968,"y":51.4994547},{"x":-0.1263803,"y":51.4994363},{"x":-0.12632,"y":51.4994204},{"x":-0.1262596,"y":51.499372},{"x":-0.126265,"y":51.4993253},{"x":-0.1262958,"y":51.4992952},{"x":-0.1263455,"y":51.499271},{"x":-0.1263964,"y":51.4992576},{"x":-0.1267169,"y":51.4992802}],"location":{"lon":-0.1264883,"lat":51.4993561,"north":51.4994547,"south":51.4992576,"east":-0.1262596,"west":-0.1267169,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"The Henry VII Lady Chapel, now more often known just as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large Lady chapel at the far eastern end of Westminster Abbey, paid for by the will of Henry VII.

In 1900, Jerome K Jerome's Miss Hobbs was staged as well as David Belasco's Madame Butterfly, which was seen by Puccini, who later turned it into what is probably his most famous opera; it was ultimately performed at the Duke of York's in 1932 by the Carl Rosa Opera Company. \n\nThe 1930s brought a number of interesting seasons, amongst them, Grand Guignol, The Ballet Rambert and the notable appearances of Markova and Dolin which greatly helped to popularise ballet in England. In the late 1970s the freehold of the theatre was purchased by Capital Radio and it closed in 1979 for refurbishment. It reopened in February 1980 and the first production under the aegis of Capital Radio was Rose, starring Glenda Jackson.

The Duke of York's has played host to the Royal Court and ATG's highly acclaimed co-production of The Weir, which ran for over 2 years and won the 1999 Olivier Award for Best New Play. It has also hosted a sellout run of Stones In His Pockets, winner of the 2001 Olivier awards for Best Comedy and Best Comedy Actor. \n\nThis was followed by Shared Experience's acclaimed production of After Mrs Rochester, Stephen Poliakoff's Sweet Panic, Michael Hastings' Calico, The Holy Terror by Simon Gray,Dirty Blonde by Claudia Shear, Ronald Harwood's The Dresser starring Nicholas Lyndhurst and Julian Glover and most recently Richard Eyre's production of Hedda Gabler starring Eve Best. \n\n\nSt Martin''s Lane\nLondon\nWC2N 4BG\nhttp://www.dukeofyorkstheatre.co.uk/\n\nhttp://www.theambassadors.com/dukeofyorks/info/index.html\n\nhttp://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/DukeOfYorksTheatre.htm\n\nhttp://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=51.510194~-0.127047&style=o&lvl=2&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=12454126&encType=1"},{"id":18507271,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18507271/Patterdale\">Patterdale</a>","title":"Patterdale","tags":[{"id":3021,"title":"high-rise"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1422161,"y":51.528966},{"x":-0.1421839,"y":51.5289427},{"x":-0.1421705,"y":51.5285772},{"x":-0.1423153,"y":51.5285806},{"x":-0.1423609,"y":51.5286039},{"x":-0.1423636,"y":51.5289643}],"location":{"lon":-0.1422671,"lat":51.5287716,"north":51.528966,"south":51.5285772,"east":-0.1421705,"west":-0.1423636,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":20},"description":"10 Floors"},{"id":21382778,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/21382778/Hampden-Gurney-Church-of-England-Primary-School\">Hampden Gurney Church of England Primary School</a>","title":"Hampden Gurney Church of England Primary School","tags":[{"id":203,"title":"school"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1645803,"y":51.5167816},{"x":-0.1642263,"y":51.5169051},{"x":-0.1640922,"y":51.5167482},{"x":-0.1640654,"y":51.5166614},{"x":-0.1641619,"y":51.5166981},{"x":-0.164296,"y":51.5166547},{"x":-0.1644409,"y":51.5166981},{"x":-0.1644945,"y":51.5167582},{"x":-0.1645482,"y":51.5167448}],"location":{"lon":-0.1643229,"lat":51.5167799,"north":51.5169051,"south":51.5166547,"east":-0.1640654,"west":-0.1645803,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"designed by Building Design Partnership, completed in 2002.
