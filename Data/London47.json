A rebuild was completed in 1348 and the monastery closed in 1538.   The church was at first used as a warehouse but in 1548, the chancel was re-opened for parish worship.   Burned down in the Great Fire, 1666, the church was rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren on the site of the former Franciscan chancel.   The distinctive tower was completed to Wren's design in 1704.   The site of the nave, to the west of the tower, became a garden.   After bomb damage in the Second Wrold War, the tower was consolidated and the remains of the church were also landscaped as a garden, minus a small area which was cleared for road widening.   More recently, the road has been narrowed and the original shape of the church reinstated.   During building work, the remaining walls were seen to contain large amounts of burnt stone re-used by Wren from the Franciscan church.   One of many examples of his re-use of older materials. \n\nthe church was largely destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. The ruins are now a public garden.\n\nhttp://londonchurchbuildings.wordpress.com/2014/01/15/5761/"},{"id":28868485,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

of England. Since November 2007, St Bartholomew-the-Great is it the first parish church in Britain to charge an entrance fee for tourists.\nIn the US TV reality show \"Treasure Hunters\", the clue found at Dover Castle lead the teams to this historic church. Benjamin Franklin worked as a printer's apprentice in a shop located in the back of the church. The teams used heat from church candles to expose a hidden map on the parchments they found at Dover. The map revealed the location of keys hidden within the church. The Fogel family was eliminated here.\nBack in real life, this is one of the oldest churches in London. Entered through an arched wynd, this is an early Gothic masterpiece, but rarely if ever noticed by passers by.\n\nhttp://www.greatstbarts.com/"},{"id":4122564,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/4122564/St-Mary-le-Bow-Church\">St Mary-le-Bow Church</a>","title":"St Mary-le-Bow Church","tags":[{"id":122,"title":"church"},{"id":46001,"title":"Grade I Listed (UK)"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary-le-Bow","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0937808,"y":51.5135985},{"x":-0.0936292,"y":51.5139106},{"x":-0.0933288,"y":51.5138547},{"x":-0.0934763,"y":51.5135417}],"location":{"lon":-0.0935548,"lat":51.5137261,"north":51.5139106,"south":51.5135417,"east":-0.0933288,"west":-0.0937808,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231464,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"The headquarters of the Anglican Diocese of Canterbury within London and home to the Court of Arches.
