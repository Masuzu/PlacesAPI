Noel Coward Theatre is located in London's Leicester Square and opened in 1903 as the New Theatre. In 1920, Noel Coward's debut play, I'll Leave It To You, was performed, and the 1930s went on to become the Golden Age of the theatre, with many of the most famous actors at the time performing on its stage including Laurence Olivier. In 1973 it was renamed the Albery Theatre and hosted many Shakespeare plays. In 2005 the Delfont Mackintosh theatre group bought the building and a year later it was renamed to the Noel Coward Theatre.

It is on the Piccadilly Line between Leicester Square and Holborn. The station is on the corner of Long Acre and James Street. It is in Travelcard Zone 1.\n\nCovent Garden station is one of the few stations in Central London for which platform access is only by lift or stairs(195 steps). It was previously \"exit only\" on Saturday afternoons, when the surrounding shopping areas are at their busiest, since so many people visit the station and there is the risk of dangerous overcrowding of the platforms. It is reportedly the busiest station on the network at which access to the platforms is primarily by lift. The \"exit only\" rule has been lifted, but from 6 June 2007 until December 2007 the station was \"exit only\" at all times while work was carried out to improve access and ticketing facilities. Posters at the station give details of the alternative methods of getting to and from Covent Garden using surrounding stations.\n\nThe journey between Leicester Square station and Covent Garden is only .26 kilometres (.161 miles), the shortest distance between two adjacent stations on the Underground network. Interestingly, this means that London Underground's standard £4 single fare for the journey between these two stations equates to £24.84 a mile, making this particular fare for this particular journey more expensive per mile than the Venice Simplon Orient Express.\n\nThe station is unusual in being tiled in a light colour pattern, as it has always been, making its passageways appear light, airy, and welcoming.\n\nThe station opened on 11 April 1907, just under four months after the start of Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (GNP&BR) services on 15 December 1906.\n\nTransport for London have committed themselves to easing the congestion at the station, which may involve the creation of a new exit further north along Long Acre (i.e. away from Covent Garden Piazza and nearer the eclectic shopping district which surrounds Neal's Yard), and the provision of escalator access.\n\nThere are four lifts which give access to street level; alternatively, there are 193 narrow and steep emergency steps to the street. During the lift journey a recorded announcement is played asking passengers to have their tickets/passes ready as they exit the lifts and where to turn for Covent Garden's market. However, during the station's improvement works in 2007, this announcement was only used in lifts 1 and 2, as exit arrangements meant that the information was less accurate for passengers in the other two lifts. However, due to a final flight of stairs from the lifts to the platforms, it does not have full disabled access.\n\nIt is said that the ghost of actor William Terriss haunts the station."},{"id":11225493,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/11225493/Buck-s-Club\">Buck's Club</a>","title":"Buck's Club","tags":null,"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck's_Club","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.14139,"y":51.5109777},{"x":-0.1412585,"y":51.5108383},{"x":-0.1415201,"y":51.5107432},{"x":-0.1416488,"y":51.5108726}],"location":{"lon":-0.1414537,"lat":51.5108604,"north":51.5109777,"south":51.5107432,"east":-0.1412585,"west":-0.1416488,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"A gentleman's club in Mayfair, London."},{"id":18507191,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18507191/Derwent\">Derwent</a>","title":"Derwent","tags":[{"id":3021,"title":"high-rise"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1402467,"y":51.5289844},{"x":-0.1403754,"y":51.5289844},{"x":-0.1403741,"y":51.5286206},{"x":-0.14024,"y":51.5286223}],"location":{"lon":-0.1403077,"lat":51.5288025,"north":51.5289844,"south":51.5286206,"east":-0.14024,"west":-0.1403754,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":20},"description":"10 Floors"},{"id":29878449,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/29878449/Peers-Court\">Peers Court</a>","title":"Peers Court","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1246744,"y":51.4989812},{"x":-0.1247307,"y":51.4986957},{"x":-0.1245618,"y":51.4986807},{"x":-0.1245135,"y":51.4989712}],"location":{"lon":-0.1246221,"lat":51.4988309,"north":51.4989812,"south":51.4986807,"east":-0.1245135,"west":-0.1247307,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":20},"description":null},{"id":1691902,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1691902/Pineapple-Dance-Studios\">Pineapple Dance Studios</a>","title":"Pineapple Dance Studios","tags":null,"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pineapple_Dance_Studios","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1253543,"y":51.5132328},{"x":-0.125172,"y":51.5131077},{"x":-0.1249574,"y":51.5132178},{"x":-0.125121,"y":51.5133447}],"location":{"lon":-0.1251559,"lat":51.5132262,"north":51.5133447,"south":51.5131077,"east":-0.1249574,"west":-0.1253543,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"At Pineapple Dance Studios you can indulge your passion for dance!

Cultural Roman (ICR - the Romanian Cultural Institute) is Romania's official organisation which promotes Romanian culture and civilisation worldwide.

From June to October 1929, the Savoy Theatre was rebuilt to a design by Frank A. Tugwell. \n\nThe Savoy Theatre was refurbished between 1989 and 1993. It hosted the 1993 World Chess Championship. It is currently showing Legally Blonde: The Musical as of December 2009. \n\nThe Savoy Theatre, currently owned by the Ambassador Theatre Group, originally had a seating capacity of 1,292, which was reduced to 986 in 1929. The current seating capacity is 1,158, distribued among three levels: Stalls, Dress Circle, and Upper Circle.\n\nThe Savoy Theatre became a Grade II* listed building on 23 October 1973.\n\nhttp://www.savoytheatre.org/\n\nhttp://www.theatres.tv/london/savoy-theatre/"},{"id":16610082,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/16610082/Royal-United-Services-Institute\">Royal United Services Institute</a>","title":"Royal United Services Institute","tags":[{"id":182,"title":"office building"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_United_Services_Institute","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.126006,"y":51.5043643},{"x":-0.1257395,"y":51.5043908},{"x":-0.1257231,"y":51.5043899},{"x":-0.1256936,"y":51.5043866},{"x":-0.1256765,"y":51.5043839},{"x":-0.125656,"y":51.5043782},{"x":-0.125644,"y":51.5043722},{"x":-0.1256346,"y":51.5043641},{"x":-0.1256279,"y":51.5043563},{"x":-0.1256225,"y":51.5043474},{"x":-0.1256198,"y":51.5043384},{"x":-0.1256188,"y":51.5043279},{"x":-0.1256205,"y":51.5043202},{"x":-0.1256238,"y":51.5043123},{"x":-0.1256299,"y":51.5043027},{"x":-0.1256379,"y":51.5042935},{"x":-0.1256492,"y":51.5042854},{"x":-0.1256627,"y":51.5042772},{"x":-0.1256751,"y":51.5042724},{"x":-0.1256859,"y":51.5042691},{"x":-0.1256952,"y":51.5042672},{"x":-0.1259048,"y":51.5042537},{"x":-0.1259155,"y":51.5042424},{"x":-0.1259457,"y":51.5042416},{"x":-0.1259645,"y":51.5042499},{"x":-0.1259672,"y":51.5042595},{"x":-0.1259859,"y":51.504257}],"location":{"lon":-0.1258124,"lat":51.5043162,"north":51.5043908,"south":51.5042416,"east":-0.1256188,"west":-0.126006,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"RUSI, Whitehall London SW1A 2ET\nThe Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI), officially still known by its old name, the Royal United Services Institution, is a British defence and security think tank.
