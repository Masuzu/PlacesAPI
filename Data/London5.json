Garden Museum, formerly known as the Museum of Garden History, is based in the deconsecrated parish church of St Mary-at-Lambeth adjacent to Lambeth Palace.\nSt Mary-at-Lambeth Church is mentioned in the Domesday Book as being owned by Countess Goda, sister of Edward the Confessor. The Bishops of Rochester were later given the living, which in 1197 passed to the Archbishops of Canterbury. The church was rebuilt in the 1370s and again in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. Philip Hardwick the Younger rebuilt the church in 1851-2 to match the tower. The church was badly damaged in the Second World War and was restored by Godfrey Allen. The church was taken over by The Tradescant Trust as the first museum of garden history in the UK. British naval officer William Bligh is buried in the churchyard behind the church.\n\nhttps://londonchurchbuildings.wordpress.com/2014/11/15/st-mary-albert-embankment-lambeth-former-now-the-museum-of-garden-history/"},{"id":7062180,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/7062180/St-Peters-Church-Vauxhall\">St Peters Church, Vauxhall</a>","title":"St Peters Church, Vauxhall","tags":[{"id":122,"title":"church"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1187504,"y":51.4869563},{"x":-0.1187685,"y":51.4869513},{"x":-0.1187873,"y":51.4869421},{"x":-0.1188,"y":51.4869317},{"x":-0.1188054,"y":51.4869162},{"x":-0.1188399,"y":51.4869135},{"x":-0.118848,"y":51.4869227},{"x":-0.1189284,"y":51.4869135},{"x":-0.118912,"y":51.4868678},{"x":-0.118904,"y":51.4868319},{"x":-0.1188899,"y":51.4868102},{"x":-0.1188852,"y":51.4867818},{"x":-0.1188664,"y":51.4867559},{"x":-0.118797,"y":51.4867624},{"x":-0.1187326,"y":51.4866012},{"x":-0.1186921,"y":51.4866027},{"x":-0.1186877,"y":51.4865929},{"x":-0.1185402,"y":51.4866104},{"x":-0.1185301,"y":51.4866279},{"x":-0.1184604,"y":51.4866363},{"x":-0.1184782,"y":51.4866837},{"x":-0.1184923,"y":51.4866824},{"x":-0.1184688,"y":51.48671},{"x":-0.1185218,"y":51.48674},{"x":-0.1184943,"y":51.4867701},{"x":-0.1185392,"y":51.4867943},{"x":-0.1185888,"y":51.4869133},{"x":-0.1186525,"y":51.4869008},{"x":-0.1186713,"y":51.4869392},{"x":-0.1186807,"y":51.4869446},{"x":-0.1186921,"y":51.4869496},{"x":-0.1187082,"y":51.4869555},{"x":-0.1187276,"y":51.4869576}],"location":{"lon":-0.1186944,"lat":51.4867752,"north":51.4869576,"south":51.4865929,"east":-0.1184604,"west":-0.1189284,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"Church of England\n\nBuilt in 1860/64 to John Loughborough Pearson's design - interior more interesting than exterior.
