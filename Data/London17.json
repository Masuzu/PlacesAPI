located inside the Imperial Institute (now Imperial College), the Imperial War Museum was moved temporarily to the Crystal Palace, located atop Sydenham Hill. The Museum was founded there in 1917 to commemorate those who had died in World War I (which was still being fought at the time). When that building burned down on 30 November 1936, a new location had to be found, and a building in Lambeth was settled on. That building, designed by Sydney Smirke, had originally been a psychiatric hospital, Bethlem Royal Hospital (otherwise known as \"Bedlam\"), located in St. George's Fields. In 1939, the Museum began including things relating to World War II, and then finally in 1953 it began its current policy of including memorabilia from all modern British conflicts. Open daily from 10 to 6.
