The name of the bridge is in memory of the British victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Thanks to its location at a strategic bend in the river, the views of London (Westminster, the South Bank and London Eye to the west, the City of London and Canary Wharf to the east) from the bridge are widely held to be the finest from any spot at ground level.\n\nThe first bridge on the site was designed by John Rennie and opened in 1817 as a toll bridge. The granite bridge had nine arches, each of 120' span, and was 2,456' long, including approaches. Before its opening it was known as 'Strand Bridge'. It was nationalised in 1878 and given to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who removed the toll from it. Serious problems were found in its construction and the new owners reinforced it. Paintings of the bridge were created by the French Impressionist Claude Monet and English Impressionist, John Constable.\n\nBy the 1920s the problems had increased. London County Council decided to demolish it and replace it with a new structure designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. The new span was partially opened in 1942 and completed in 1945. The new bridge was the only Thames bridge to have been damaged by German bombers during World War II. The building contractor was Peter Lind & Company Limited. It is frequently asserted that the work force was largely female and it is sometimes referred to as \"the women's bridge\", but there appears to be no contemporary evidence for this. It is constructed in Portland stone from the South West of England; the stone cleans itself whenever it rains in London.\n\nGranite stones from the original bridge were subsequently \"presented to various parts of the British world to further historic links in the British Commonwealth of Nations\". Two of these stones are in Canberra, the capital city of Australia, sited between the parallel spans of the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge, one of two major crossings of Lake Burley Griffin in the heart of the city.\n\nWaterloo Bridge, seen from the London Eye observation wheelThe south end of the bridge is the area known as The South Bank and includes the Royal Festival Hall, Waterloo station, Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Royal National Theatre, and the National Film Theatre (which resides directly beneath the bridge). The north end passes above the Victoria Embankment where the road joins the Strand and Aldwych alongside Somerset House.\n\nTrivia\nIn 1940 a film starring Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor was released called Waterloo Bridge. \nWaterloo Bridge is the name of a film released in 1931. \nWaterloo Sunset is a song written by Ray Davies and recorded in 1967 by The Kinks. Its lyrics describe two people meeting at Waterloo Station and then crossing over the river (via Waterloo Bridge, as Ray Davies has confirmed). The inspirational sunset described in the song would almost certainly have been viewed from the bridge itself, looking out over the River Thames. (See also the remarks above about the fine views from the bridge.) \nMichael Faraday tried in 1832 to measure the potential difference between each side of the bridge caused by the ebbing salt water flowing through the Earth's magnetic field.  \n\n'After the Lunch' is a poem by Wendy Cope and is about two lovers parting on Waterloo Bridge"},{"id":24418649,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/24418649/Squirrel-s-paradise\">Squirrel's paradise</a>","title":"Squirrel's paradise","tags":[{"id":194,"title":"park"},{"id":10146,"title":"squirrels"},{"id":44839,"title":"public toilet"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1594908,"y":51.5049981},{"x":-0.1595552,"y":51.5050115},{"x":-0.1598663,"y":51.5045006},{"x":-0.1597644,"y":51.5044839},{"x":-0.1598824,"y":51.5043103},{"x":-0.1600058,"y":51.5042435},{"x":-0.1604832,"y":51.5036725},{"x":-0.1595606,"y":51.5036558},{"x":-0.1589812,"y":51.5036458},{"x":-0.1589383,"y":51.5036959},{"x":-0.1593406,"y":51.5048345}],"location":{"lon":-0.1597108,"lat":51.5043286,"north":51.5050115,"south":51.5036458,"east":-0.1589383,"west":-0.1604832,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":null},{"id":4460749,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/4460749/St-Pancras-Renaissance-London-Hotel\">St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel</a>","title":"St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel","tags":[{"id":50,"title":"hotel"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pancras_Renaissance_London_Hotel","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1262838,"y":51.5293048},{"x":-0.1265734,"y":51.5303293},{"x":-0.1263374,"y":51.5304027},{"x":-0.1269194,"y":51.5311235},{"x":-0.12667,"y":51.531197},{"x":-0.1256883,"y":51.5299705},{"x":-0.1245913,"y":51.5303026},{"x":-0.1244572,"y":51.5301291},{"x":-0.125927,"y":51.5296919},{"x":-0.1260182,"y":51.5296268},{"x":-0.1260665,"y":51.5295467},{"x":-0.1260531,"y":51.5294432},{"x":-0.1259968,"y":51.5293682},{"x":-0.1262408,"y":51.5292614}],"location":{"lon":-0.1256883,"lat":51.5302292,"north":51.531197,"south":51.5292614,"east":-0.1244572,"west":-0.1269194,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lonpr-st-pancras-renaissance-london-hotel/\nExcellent selection of recent photographs: http://www.urbanxphotography.co.uk/stpancras \n\nHistoric Victorian hotel, built as the Midland Grand Hotel in 1873.

Royal Festival Hall is a concert, dance, and talks venue that is part of the Southbank Centre in the London Borough of Newham. The 2,900-seat venue was originally built from 1949 to 1951 as part of the Festival of Britain, which was held in 1951. The Modernist-styled hall was designed by Leslie Martin, Peter Moro, and Robert Matthew. Since the late 1980s, the foyer spaces of the hall have been one of the best-used public spaces in London. The hall hosted the 1960 Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nThe hall was substantially altered in 1964 by adding foyers and terraces to the river side and more dressing rooms to the rear. From 2005 until 2007, the hall underwent a £91,000,000 renovation.\n\nThe Royal Festival Hall became a Grade I listed building in April 1988.\n\n+44 844 875

Lewis Department Store run by partners (not employees).\n\nThe business was founded in 1864 when John Lewis set up a draper's shop in Oxford Street, London, which developed into a department store. In 1905 he bought the Peter Jones store in Sloane Square. In 1920 his son, John Spedan Lewis, expanded earlier power-sharing policies by sharing the profits the business made among the employees. The democratic nature and profit-sharing basis of the business were developed into a formal partnership structure and Spedan Lewis bequeathed the company to his employees. In January 2006, over 64,000 partners worked for the John Lewis Partnership, whereof the majority worked full-time.\n\nThe principle and slogan Never knowingly undersold was adopted in 1925. It was created by Spedan Lewis and applied to the company's Peter Jones store in Sloane Square, London. It stated that if a customer could buy the same item cheaper elsewhere they would refund the difference. Today, the company still honours this pledge, and many of their competitors also offer such a pledge. The principle has been more refined, most notably to exclude online shopping. However, they are the only large retailer that will match the price with any UK shop, not restricting it to a local area. The policy is also to monitor local competitors and reduce the shelf edge price if they are being 'undersold'. Staff (partners) also get paid £2 for every time they notify the company that they are being 'undersold'.\n\nThe present shop on Oxford Street was completed in 1960, the original buildings having been bombed during the war and gradually rebuilt. The sculpture Winged Figure by Barbara Hepworth was added in 1962."},{"id":981709,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/981709/Bloomsbury-Square-Gardens\">Bloomsbury Square Gardens</a>","title":"Bloomsbury Square Gardens","tags":[{"id":129,"title":"square"},{"id":194,"title":"park"},{"id":499,"title":"playground"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1235908,"y":51.5191566},{"x":-0.1236337,"y":51.5190281},{"x":-0.1228371,"y":51.5183342},{"x":-0.1226822,"y":51.5183196},{"x":-0.1220506,"y":51.5185858},{"x":-0.1220217,"y":51.5186913},{"x":-0.1227728,"y":51.5193719},{"x":-0.1230088,"y":51.5193936}],"location":{"lon":-0.1228277,"lat":51.5188566,"north":51.5193936,"south":51.5183196,"east":-0.1220217,"west":-0.1236337,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Nice little park.

and a dingy row of shops behind a rather gloomy colonnade at street level was originally Amoco House  - the London HQ of the American oil company Amoco, who themselves are long gone - having been

It became known as Scotland Yard – the official residence of the Kings of Scotland in London.\n\nAlthough not a victim of the Great Fire in 1666, Whitehall was destroyed by another fire in 1698 and private residences were built in the area, occupied through the years by some well-known historical figures – John Milton, Inigo Jones, Sir Christopher Wren and Sir John Van Brugh. Scotland Yard was also the home of the Metropolitan Police Force between 1829 and 1966, when the office was moved to New Scotland Yard at St. James’.\n\nWhitehall Court, built in 1884 in the style of a French château, is now listed as a building of architectural interest. The exterior is original, although the interior has been considerably changed. When built, the block was divided into full serviced apartments of three or more bedrooms each. The ground floor housed numerous amenities, including a restaurant and a smoking room. Whitehall Court’s history is dotted with names of famous residents such as William Gladstone, Lord Kitchener, Grand Duke Michael of Russia, George Bernard Shaw, and many more. \n\nDuring World War I, the eighth floor quarters in block two (now the hotel) were used by the Secret Service. During World War II, most of the building was taken over by Government departments; the fifth floor utilized by Russian Embassy, the sixth floor by the American Embassy, and the seventh floor by the Air Training Corps.\n\n\nhttp://www.guoman.com/en/hotels/united_kingdom/london/the_royal_horseguards/index.html"},{"id":13833147,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/13833147/Maria-Fidelis-RC-Convent-School-FCJ\">Maria Fidelis RC Convent School FCJ</a>","title":"Maria Fidelis RC Convent School FCJ","tags":[{"id":203,"title":"school"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Fidelis_Convent_School","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1384529,"y":51.5280165},{"x":-0.1384529,"y":51.5280633},{"x":-0.1382491,"y":51.5280666},{"x":-0.1382491,"y":51.5281334},{"x":-0.1368785,"y":51.5281367},{"x":-0.1368678,"y":51.5279298},{"x":-0.1368195,"y":51.5279298},{"x":-0.1367015,"y":51.5279698},{"x":-0.1366049,"y":51.5278897},{"x":-0.1377851,"y":51.5273958},{"x":-0.137828,"y":51.5273958}],"location":{"lon":-0.1375289,"lat":51.5277662,"north":51.5281367,"south":51.5273958,"east":-0.1366049,"west":-0.1384529,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"This rather severe building, on the corner of North Gower Street and Starcross Street, houses the Lower School section of this Roman Catholic girls' school.

central quadrangle of the British Museum in London was redeveloped to a design by Foster and Partners to become the Queen Elizabeth II Great Court, commonly referred to simply as the Great Court, during the late 1990s. It was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2000. The court has a tessellated glass roof designed by Buro Happold covering the entire court and surrounds the original circular British Museum Reading Room in the centre, now a museum. It is the largest covered square in Europe. The glass and steel roof is made up of 4878 unique steel members connected at 1566 unique nodes and 1,656 pairs of glass windowpanes making up 6100m2 of glazing; each of a unique shape because of the undulating nature of the roof."},{"id":1751192,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1751192/Peabody-Estate\">Peabody Estate</a>","title":"Peabody Estate","tags":[{"id":9313,"title":"estates"},{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1208174,"y":51.5146284},{"x":-0.1212519,"y":51.5142444},{"x":-0.1201844,"y":51.5138021},{"x":-0.1195273,"y":51.5144247},{"x":-0.1196399,"y":51.5144665},{"x":-0.1199672,"y":51.5144948},{"x":-0.1204017,"y":51.5145432}],"location":{"lon":-0.1203896,"lat":51.5142152,"north":51.5146284,"south":51.5138021,"east":-0.1195273,"west":-0.1212519,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Housing Estate\n\nIn the past year, Peabody Tenants Association have participated in the Covent Garden Flower Festival and the Peabody Trust, from our yearly grant, supplied bench seats and large flower planters for the elderly to congregate and have a chat. We are in the process of negotiating for people who did not take advantage of last year's offer of flower boxes and who wish to have them this year. Christmas was a great success with a 12ft Christmas tree with lights, carol singers, and Father Christmas who distributed presents and crackers to all the children, with mince pies and wine for the adults. To make the event illuminating, we received new flood lights in the garden. The OAPs received a Christmas present in the form of £10 notes and the children had a Christmas party at Pizza Hut. Our AGM this year was a huge success, with wine and nibbles. The proprietor of Sarastro's, \"King Richard\", invited 22 tenants to his restaurant for a evening of free entertainment, which was much appreciated. Our tenants are very appreciative of his generosity. We have asked Peabody Trust to support us in opposing planning permission for a new hotel in Great Queen Street and Wild Street, which would be very close to our estate. We are still looking for support from anyone who may be affected by this, because of extra noise, traffic and inconvenience."},{"id":981452,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/981452/Baker-Street-Underground-Station\">Baker Street Underground Station</a>","title":"Baker Street Underground Station","tags":[{"id":44758,"title":"metro station"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Street_tube_station","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1572859,"y":51.5226497},{"x":-0.1574641,"y":51.5230491},{"x":-0.1575181,"y":51.5230402},{"x":-0.1575369,"y":51.5230878},{"x":-0.1574604,"y":51.5231012},{"x":-0.1575298,"y":51.5232411},{"x":-0.1575419,"y":51.5232394},{"x":-0.1576572,"y":51.5234305},{"x":-0.1576736,"y":51.5234273},{"x":-0.1579685,"y":51.5236993},{"x":-0.157738,"y":51.523805},{"x":-0.1573421,"y":51.5236424},{"x":-0.1574105,"y":51.5235832},{"x":-0.157271,"y":51.523483},{"x":-0.1573179,"y":51.5234588},{"x":-0.1572284,"y":51.523391},{"x":-0.1571114,"y":51.523307},{"x":-0.1569639,"y":51.5233754},{"x":-0.1565602,"y":51.5230617},{"x":-0.1566514,"y":51.5230224},{"x":-0.1565897,"y":51.5229832},{"x":-0.1564771,"y":51.5230717},{"x":-0.1562357,"y":51.522969},{"x":-0.1563376,"y":51.5228731},{"x":-0.1564073,"y":51.5229039},{"x":-0.1563872,"y":51.5229206},{"x":-0.1564636,"y":51.5229532},{"x":-0.1564931,"y":51.5229265},{"x":-0.1565119,"y":51.5229348},{"x":-0.1565428,"y":51.5229131},{"x":-0.1564355,"y":51.5228672},{"x":-0.156318,"y":51.5228125},{"x":-0.1566688,"y":51.5227512},{"x":-0.1572834,"y":51.5226506},{"x":-0.1572365,"y":51.5223927},{"x":-0.1572888,"y":51.5223226},{"x":-0.157333,"y":51.5223151},{"x":-0.157447,"y":51.5223568},{"x":-0.1572405,"y":51.5223927}],"location":{"lon":-0.1571021,"lat":51.52306,"north":51.523805,"south":51.5223151,"east":-0.1562357,"west":-0.1579685,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Baker Street tube station is a station on the London Underground located at the junction of Baker Street and the Marylebone Road.

Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) is a United Kingdom government department. The department was created on 28 June 2007 on the disbanding of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). BERR has a wide range of responsibilities. The main areas covered are essentially those previously covered by the DTI: Company Law, Trade, Business Growth, Employment Law, Regional Economic Development, Energy and Consumer Law. The principal machinery of government changes affecting the department were the removal of the Office of Science and Innovation to the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the arrival of the Better Regulation Executive from the Cabinet Office.\n\nThis is the 1 Victoria Street office, it includes a conference centre.

\nThe Savoy Hotel, London Opened in 1889, it was built by Richard D'Oyly Carte, the owner of the nearby Savoy Theatre. It was and remains one of London's most prestigious and opulent hotels, with 230 rooms. Its name derives from the Savoy Palace which once occupied the site. Its first manager was César Ritz, who later became the founder of The Ritz Hotel. The hotel was designed by T. E. Collcutt, who also designed the Wigmore Hall. The hotel was built on a plot of land next to the Savoy Theatre, originally purchased to build an electrical generator for the theatre which was the first public building in the world to be lit by electricity.\n\nThe Savoy has long been famous for its inventive chefs. Its kitchen saw the invention of Pêche Melba, created in honour of Dame Nellie Melba by the legendary French chef Auguste Escoffier. Melba toast is also attributed to the hotel's kitchen; it is said that Dame Nellie ordered toast and was served with several pieces that were unusually thin and crisp and almost burnt, thus creating a new dish.\n\nOne curiosity of the Savoy is the fact that its forecourt (Savoy Court) is the only street in the United Kingdom where vehicles are required to drive on the right. This is said to date from the days when a cab driver would reach his arm out of the driver's door window to open the passenger's door (which opened backwards and had the handle at the front), without having to get out of the cab himself. (See Hackney carriage)\n\nClaude Monet and James Whistler both stayed at the hotel and painted views from their rooms of the River Thames. Bob Dylan stayed in the hotel in 1965, and filmed the video clip Subterranean Homesick Blues in an adjacent alley. Nobel prize winning economist Amartya Sen prefers the hotel when staying in London. However the quality of service at the hotel has been questioned. In 1991 a guest received severe burns and no first aid care was provided at the time.\n\nIn 2005, the Savoy was purchased by the Fairmont Hotels and Resorts of Canada from Maybourne Hotel group, formerly known as The Savoy Group.\n\nSavoy Pier is located near the river entrance to the hotel, but is not affiliated to the hotel. It is a stop on the Thames Clipper commuter service, connecting the Savoy with the City of London, Canary Wharf and Greenwich via a river boat service.\n\nGrand famous restaurant for which Marcus Wareing has won a Michelin star.  Favourite haunt of Winston Churchill and the Queen Mother.  The tradition was that when the Queen Mother came in or left, the other diners would stand and applaud her."},{"id":955677,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/955677/Radisson-Blu-Portman-Hotel-London\">Radisson Blu Portman Hotel, London</a>","title":"Radisson Blu Portman Hotel, London","tags":[{"id":50,"title":"hotel"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1587411,"y":51.5163595},{"x":-0.158717,"y":51.5163149},{"x":-0.1586842,"y":51.5163211},{"x":-0.1584488,"y":51.5158217},{"x":-0.1584005,"y":51.5158283},{"x":-0.1583817,"y":51.5157925},{"x":-0.1581544,"y":51.5158371},{"x":-0.1581786,"y":51.515873},{"x":-0.1573625,"y":51.5160115},{"x":-0.1574852,"y":51.5162777},{"x":-0.1574329,"y":51.5163045},{"x":-0.1574389,"y":51.5163174},{"x":-0.1574557,"y":51.5163132},{"x":-0.1574919,"y":51.5163942},{"x":-0.1575764,"y":51.516574}],"location":{"lon":-0.1580518,"lat":51.5161832,"north":51.516574,"south":51.5157925,"east":-0.1573625,"west":-0.1587411,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"The Portman Hotel is located just off Oxford Street\n\n22 Portman Square\nLondon \nW1H7BG\n\nhttp://www.radissonblu.co.uk/hotel-london"},{"id":10798429,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/10798429/Victoria-House\">Victoria House</a>","title":"Victoria House","tags":[{"id":182,"title":"office building"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1212895,"y":51.5189547},{"x":-0.1218474,"y":51.5187177},{"x":-0.1227862,"y":51.5195722},{"x":-0.1222765,"y":51.5197858}],"location":{"lon":-0.1220379,"lat":51.5192517,"north":51.5197858,"south":51.5187177,"east":-0.1212895,"west":-0.1227862,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":null},{"id":1020565,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1020565/Queen-Square\">Queen Square</a>","title":"Queen Square","tags":[{"id":129,"title":"square"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Square,_London","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1230866,"y":51.522139},{"x":-0.1221102,"y":51.5210342},{"x":-0.1216489,"y":51.5211878},{"x":-0.1226091,"y":51.5222892}],"location":{"lon":-0.1223678,"lat":51.5216617,"north":51.5222892,"south":51.5210342,"east":-0.1216489,"west":-0.1230866,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Queen Square is a comparatively small garden square in Bloomsbury, London, located approximately 200 metres (220 yards) east of Russell Square. The square was originally named Queen Anne's Square because a statue contained within it was misidentified as depicting Queen Anne. This statue is now believed to a portrayal of Queen Charlotte, wife of King George III.\n\nMany of the buildings surrounding the square are devoted to providing, researching and administering health care.\n\nGeorge III was treated in a house on Queen Square when it was thought that he had gone mad. There is a public house on its southwest corner called the Queen’s Larder as, according to legend, the building was used by Queen Charlotte to store food for the King during his treatment.

Its architecture is among the most modern in Covent Garden, and is unique in its design and gardens.
