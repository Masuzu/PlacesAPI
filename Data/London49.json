Clement Danes is a church in the City of Westminster, London. It is situated outside the Royal Courts of Justice on the Strand. The current building was completed in 1682 by Sir Christopher Wren.\n\nThe church is sometimes claimed to be the one featured in the nursery rhyme Oranges and Lemons and the bells do indeed play that tune. However, St Clement Eastcheap, in the City of London, also claims to be the church from the rhyme. It is known as one of the two 'Island Churches', the other being St Mary-le-Strand.\n\nAlso the Church of the Royal Air Force.\nFollowing an appeal for funds by the Royal Air Force, the church was completely restored and was re-consecrated on 19 October 1958 to become the Central Church of the Royal Air Force.\n\nServices are regularly held to commemorate prominent occasions of the RAF and its associated organisations. There are also features throughout and outside the building commemorating people and units of the RAF.\n\nAs part of the rebuilding, a Latin inscription was added over the main door of the church, translating as: \"Built by Christopher Wren 1682. Destroyed by the thunderbolts of air warfare 1941. Restored by the Royal Air Force 1958\""},{"id":1151889,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1151889/Temple-Underground-Station\">Temple Underground Station</a>","title":"Temple Underground Station","tags":[{"id":44629,"title":"invisible"},{"id":44758,"title":"metro station"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_tube_station","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1142312,"y":51.5110243},{"x":-0.1141588,"y":51.5109042},{"x":-0.1135942,"y":51.5109792},{"x":-0.1136666,"y":51.5111428}],"location":{"lon":-0.1139127,"lat":51.5110235,"north":51.5111428,"south":51.5109042,"east":-0.1135942,"west":-0.1142312,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"Temple is a London Underground station in the City of Westminster, between Victoria Embankment and Temple Place.

All that remains of the church is the tower, built around 1320 as part of the second church on the site.\n\nThe first mention of the church was in the late 12th century. It was named \"Staining\", which means stone, to distinguish it from the other churches of All Hallows in the City of London, which were wooden.\n\nThe old church survived the Great Fire of London in 1666 but collapsed five years later in 1671. It was thought its foundations had been weakened by too many burials in the churchyard close to the church walls. The church was rebuilt in 1674.\n\nThe parishes of All Hallows Staining and nearby St Olave Hart Street were combined in 1870. At that time All Hallows Staining was demolished, leaving only the tower.\n\nSt Olave Hart Street was badly damaged by bombs in 1941, during the Second World War. Between 1948 and 1954, when the restored St Olave's was reopened, a prefabricated church stood on the site of All Hallows Staining. This was known as St Olave Mark Lane. The tower of All Hallows Staining was used as the chancel of the temporary church.\n\nThe tower of All Hallows Staining is maintained by the Worshipful Company of Clothworkers, one of the livery companies of the City of London. In 1957 the Clothworkers' Company built a church hall for St Olave Hart Street on the site of All Hallows Staining. The old tower now stands at the back of a small courtyard next to the new hall."},{"id":32459246,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

was a gate in the London wall between Cripplegate and Bishopsgate. Despite being the most well-preserved thanks to the tube and railway station, it was one of the least important leading out onto Moorfields. Originally a small door in the wall, it became a proper gate in the 15th century but was demolished in 1762.\n\nThe street called \"Moorgate\" originally ran through the gate out to Moorfields, a small area of moorland that was used as a camp for people left homeless in the Great Fire of London. Moorgate has a tube station which is served by the Circle, Metropolitan, H&C and Northern Lines as well as some National Rail services.\n\nThe 8 gates to the City of London are:\n1. Cripplegate\n2. Aldgate\n3. Aldersgate\n4. Ludgate\n5. Bishopsgate\n6. Moorgate\n7. Newgate\n8.
