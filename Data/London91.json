Portland Street is a London Underground station near Regent's Park. It is between Baker Street and Euston Square on the Hammersmith & City, Circle and Metropolitan lines. It is in Travelcard Zone 1.\n\nThe station was part of the world's first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, which opened between \"Bishop's Road\" (now Paddington Hammersmith & City Line) and \"Farringdon Street\" (close to the present-day Farringdon station). It was opened on January 10, 1863 as \"Portland Road\", and was given its present name on 1 March 1917.\n\nLocal points of interest include Regent's Park, and the Post Office Tower, which was London's tallest building when it opened in the 1960s. The station is very close to Regent's Park station, which is on the Bakerloo Line.\n\nThe station is across the street from the main building of International Student House, a student residence and hostel and is also near Harley Street, famous for its doctors and surgeons.\n\nThe station is within easy walking distance of Regent's Park and Warren Street tube stations."},{"id":3790077,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/3790077/Embassy-of-the-Republic-of-Turkey\">Embassy of the Republic of
