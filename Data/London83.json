Lanesborough is a prestigious five-star hotel on Hyde Park Corner at Knightsbridge in the City of Westminster, London. It is reputedly the most expensive hotel in London, the highest rate being up to £14,000 per night for the \"Lanesborough Suite\". A 24-hour private butler is available to each guest. The Lanesborough has accommodated visiting royalty, eminent politicians, and entertainers. Opposite are Hyde Park and Apsley House, the former home of the Duke of Wellington. The hotel is next to the Hyde Park Corner tube station.\n\nThe Lanesborough, designed by William Wilkins, was originally constructed from 1827 to 1844 as a 350-bed facility for St George's Hospital. Originally having three floors, a fourth floor was added in 1859. It was closed in 1980 and remained vacant until it was refurbished and reopened as a hotel in 1991. The hotel has 93 rooms (including 43 suites), a restaurant, a bar, 6 meeting rooms, and a spa.\n\nhttp://www.thelanesborough.co.uk/"},{"id":7125944,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/7125944/Indica-Gallery\">Indica Gallery </a>","title":"Indica Gallery ","tags":[{"id":45202,"title":"art museum / art gallery"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indica_Gallery","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1376684,"y":51.5072834},{"x":-0.1379447,"y":51.5075789},{"x":-0.1374337,"y":51.5077475},{"x":-0.1374927,"y":51.5078118},{"x":-0.1371306,"y":51.5079345},{"x":-0.1368141,"y":51.5076148},{"x":-0.1373908,"y":51.5074169},{"x":-0.1373693,"y":51.5073911}],"location":{"lon":-0.1373794,"lat":51.5076089,"north":51.5079345,"south":51.5072834,"east":-0.1368141,"west":-0.1379447,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"John was introduced to Yoko by John Dunbar on the 9th November 1966 at the Indica Gallery at 6 Mason's Yard (Off Duke Street), St James, Westminster (not sure exactly where that is in Mason's Yard--I live in Seattle).

It is a historic Edwardian-style building with 11 floors and a height of 41 m (134 ft). It was originally built in 1889 as a gentlemen's club and apartment building. Damaged by a fire in 1899, it reopened after renovations in 1902 as the Hyde Park Hotel. Throughout its history, many important events were held in the hotel. The Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group purchased the Hyde Park Hotel in 1996 and the building was subsequently renovated at a cost of £57,000,000, reopening in May 2000.\n\nThe Mandarin Oriental Hyde Park, London has 173 rooms and 25 suites.

It is one of the precursors of the mid-19th century European shopping gallery and the modern shopping centre. The Burlington Arcade was built \"for the sale of jewellery and fancy articles of fashionable demand, for the gratification of the public\".\n\nThe arcade was built to the order of Lord George Cavendish, younger brother of the 5th Duke of Devonshire, who had inherited the adjacent Burlington House, on what had been the side garden of the house. His architect was Samuel Ware. The Arcade opened in 1819. It consisted of a single straight top-lit walkway lined with seventy-two small two storey units. Some of the units have now been combined, reducing the number of shops to around forty. The ponderous Piccadilly façade in a late version of Victorian Mannerism was added in the early 20th century.\n\n \nShop fronts inside the arcadeThe pedestrian arcade, with smart uniform shopfronts under a glazed roof, has always been an upmarket retail location. It is patrolled by Burlington Arcade Beadles in traditional uniforms including top hats and tailcoats. The original beadles were all former members of Lord George Cavendish's regiment, the 10th Hussars. Present tenants include a range of clothing, footwear and accessory shops, art and antique dealers and the jewellers and dealers in antique silver for which the Arcade is best known.\n\n \nThe Piccadilly entrance to the Burlington Arcade in 1827-28.  The Burlington Arcade was the successful prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the Saint-Hubert Gallery in Brussels and The Passage in St Petersburg, the first of Europe's grand arcades, to the Galleria Umberto I in Naples or the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan.\n\nhttp://www.burlington-arcade.co.uk/"},{"id":28874145,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/28874145/Khabe\">Khabe</a>","title":"Khabe","tags":[{"id":74,"title":"restaurant"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1672005,"y":51.5239334},{"x":-0.1663017,"y":51.5243988},{"x":-0.165866,"y":51.5245926},{"x":-0.1657094,"y":51.524649},{"x":-0.1656711,"y":51.5246496},{"x":-0.1656323,"y":51.5246122},{"x":-0.1656087,"y":51.5245723},{"x":-0.1656504,"y":51.5245304},{"x":-0.166296,"y":51.5241755},{"x":-0.1670357,"y":51.5238165}],"location":{"lon":-0.1664046,"lat":51.524233,"north":51.5246496,"south":51.5238165,"east":-0.1656087,"west":-0.1672005,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":null},{"id":17869374,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/17869374/Cavendish-Square-33\">Cavendish Square, 33</a>","title":"","tags":[{"id":182,"title":"office building"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1441513,"y":51.5160231},{"x":-0.1439273,"y":51.5160603},{"x":-0.143867,"y":51.5159288},{"x":-0.1434378,"y":51.5159981},{"x":-0.1433748,"y":51.5158579},{"x":-0.1434647,"y":51.515842},{"x":-0.143415,"y":51.5157302},{"x":-0.143745,"y":51.5156668},{"x":-0.1437235,"y":51.51562},{"x":-0.1432957,"y":51.5156935},{"x":-0.1432367,"y":51.515575},{"x":-0.1436698,"y":51.5154974},{"x":-0.1438871,"y":51.5154565}],"location":{"lon":-0.143694,"lat":51.5157584,"north":51.5160603,"south":51.5154565,"east":-0.1432367,"west":-0.1441513,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Construction of this office building was started in 1958 and was completed in 1962.

The main site in Covent Garden uses the name of its parent institution, sometimes suffixed by Covent Garden, and is open to the public every day, having recently reopened following a two year refurbishment. The other site, located in Acton, is known as the London Transport Museum Depot and is principally a storage site that is open on regular days throughout the year.\n\nThe museum was briefly re-named London's Transport Museum to reflect its coverage of topics beyond London Transport, but it reverted to its previous name in 2007 to coincide with the reopening of the Covent Garden site.\n\n"},{"id":9714261,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/9714261/Department-for-Work-and-Pensions\">Department for Work and Pensions</a>","title":"Department for Work and Pensions","tags":[{"id":182,"title":"office building"},{"id":2356,"title":"ministry / government department"},{"id":51982,"title":"pension services"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_for_Work_and_Pensions","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1252485,"y":51.5025419},{"x":-0.125235,"y":51.5025561},{"x":-0.1252002,"y":51.5025569},{"x":-0.1251117,"y":51.5025502},{"x":-0.1250915,"y":51.5025302},{"x":-0.1250942,"y":51.5025077},{"x":-0.1250982,"y":51.5024927},{"x":-0.1251291,"y":51.5024926},{"x":-0.1251371,"y":51.5023407},{"x":-0.1252042,"y":51.5023416},{"x":-0.1252042,"y":51.5022923},{"x":-0.1251612,"y":51.5022907},{"x":-0.1251613,"y":51.5022739},{"x":-0.1251666,"y":51.5022622},{"x":-0.1251787,"y":51.5022572},{"x":-0.125239,"y":51.5022523},{"x":-0.1252471,"y":51.5021905},{"x":-0.1252873,"y":51.5021922},{"x":-0.1252927,"y":51.5021387},{"x":-0.1253182,"y":51.5021371},{"x":-0.1253222,"y":51.5020886},{"x":-0.1254134,"y":51.5020903},{"x":-0.1254161,"y":51.5020803},{"x":-0.1255207,"y":51.5020836},{"x":-0.1255207,"y":51.5021345},{"x":-0.1255824,"y":51.5021345},{"x":-0.1256038,"y":51.5021654},{"x":-0.1255864,"y":51.5024584},{"x":-0.1256562,"y":51.5024618},{"x":-0.1256937,"y":51.502122},{"x":-0.1255971,"y":51.502122},{"x":-0.1255958,"y":51.502056},{"x":-0.1256092,"y":51.5020451},{"x":-0.1258747,"y":51.5020535},{"x":-0.1258976,"y":51.5020727},{"x":-0.1258466,"y":51.5025478}],"location":{"lon":-0.1254946,"lat":51.502301,"north":51.5025569,"south":51.5020451,"east":-0.1250915,"west":-0.1258976,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"The Department for Work and Pensions (or DWP) (Welsh: Adran Gwaith a Phensiynau) is the largest government department in the Government of the United Kingdom, created on June 8, 2001, from the merger of the employment part of the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Social Security.
