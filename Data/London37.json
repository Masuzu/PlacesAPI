Thames, interesting street containing old factory buildings, was the setting for Fagin's Den in Charles Dickens' Book - Oliver Twist.   The street name originates from the parish of St John, Horsleydown and was formerly St-John-at-Thames.   This was part of the narrow medieval riverside route, developed by the monks of Bermondsey Abbey as part of their river wall or flood defences.   It became an important street for warehousing and wharfage in the the Victorian period and some industrial uses survived into the early 1990s.   A lot of the original industrial buildings survive to give the area its unique atmosphere, although the famous smell of spices has gone.   Many of the buildings are quite successful mock-ups in the warehouse style."},{"id":16673589,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

However in the early 1980's the land was purchased by the London Docklands Development Committee who did actually build houses on the land as the regeneration of the east end of London began."},{"id":18607782,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18607782/Berner-Estate-north\">Berner Estate (north)</a>","title":"Berner Estate (north)","tags":[{"id":44835,"title":"public telephone"},{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0646734,"y":51.5116471},{"x":-0.0646734,"y":51.5120144},{"x":-0.0641477,"y":51.5120144},{"x":-0.0640941,"y":51.511607},{"x":-0.0617337,"y":51.5116671},{"x":-0.0617337,"y":51.5117406},{"x":-0.0613582,"y":51.5117807},{"x":-0.0614119,"y":51.5125018},{"x":-0.0634611,"y":51.5124617},{"x":-0.0634396,"y":51.5127154},{"x":-0.0634825,"y":51.5132029},{"x":-0.0628388,"y":51.5132696},{"x":-0.0627637,"y":51.5140709},{"x":-0.0642228,"y":51.5142378},{"x":-0.0642657,"y":51.5135968},{"x":-0.065403,"y":51.5135367},{"x":-0.0653386,"y":51.5129692},{"x":-0.0665295,"y":51.5128957},{"x":-0.0664544,"y":51.5125819},{"x":-0.0663042,"y":51.5116605},{"x":-0.0657678,"y":51.5116204}],"location":{"lon":-0.0639439,"lat":51.5129224,"north":51.5142378,"south":51.511607,"east":-0.0613582,"west":-0.0665295,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":15},"description":""},{"id":852,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/852/The-Tower-of-London\">The Tower of London</a>","title":"The Tower of London","tags":[{"id":55,"title":"tower"},{"id":61,"title":"palace"},{"id":101,"title":"castle"},{"id":127,"title":"museum"},{"id":1033,"title":"citadel"},{"id":1107,"title":"place with historical importance"},{"id":2570,"title":"fortification"},{"id":44858,"title":"UNESCO World Heritage Site"},{"id":46296,"title":"scheduled ancient monument"},{"id":53756,"title":"tourist attraction"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0785668,"y":51.5077059},{"x":-0.0775798,"y":51.5091679},{"x":-0.0757238,"y":51.5093549},{"x":-0.0741258,"y":51.5089679},{"x":-0.0745548,"y":51.5069849},{"x":-0.0758098,"y":51.5070709}],"location":{"lon":-0.0763463,"lat":51.5081699,"north":51.5093549,"south":51.5069849,"east":-0.0741258,"west":-0.0785668,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231464,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":15},"description":"Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress The Tower of London, more commonly known as the Tower of London, is a historic monument in central London on the north bank of the River Thames. It is located within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets and is separated from the eastern edge of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill.\n\nThe Tower of London is often identified with the White Tower, the original stark, square fortress built by William the Conqueror in 1078. However, the Tower as a whole is a complex of several buildings set within two parallel rings of defensive walls and a moat.\n\nThe Tower's primary function was a fortress, a royal palace and a prison (particularly for high status and royal prisoners, such as the Princes in the Tower and the future Queen Elizabeth I). This last use has led to the phrase \"sent to the Tower\" (meaning \"imprisoned\"). It has also served as a place of execution and torture, an armoury, a treasury, a zoo, a mint, a public records office, an observatory, and since 1303, the home of the Crown Jewels of England.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6iUU9wbM3k"},{"id":15582147,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

It had a gate in each side and would most probably have conformed to the common Roman rectangular fort plan.\n\nThe fort was probably built to house the official guard of the Governor of Britain, who was based in Londinium. At least 1,000 men, cavalry and infantry, would’ve been housed in the fort’s barrack blocks around the central range of administrative buildings and stores.\n\nThe walls surviving here form the curved south-west corner of the fort with the foundations of a rectangular corner watch-tower. The fort wall was originally about 4 feet (1.2 m) thick and at least 15 feet high (4.5m).\n\nWhen the Roman City Wall was built c. AD 200, two sides of the fort were incorporated into the City’s defences.

is one of the (many) London railway stations serving the southeastern main line to Kent, and is the largest of them. The station is served by through trains from Charing Cross, Cannon Street and Blackfriars, to and from Dover, Ramsgate, Hastings and Brighton. These use the 6 through platforms to the north. The main trainshed has 9 additional bays mostly for trains on the Brighton Main Line (mostly suburban) and the south London lines.\nThe station is due for improvement which will replace the newer concourse, add additional through platforms and take out three bays. It will also see the construction of Shard London Bridge, which will become the tallest building in London.\nWhen London Bridge was expanded, it ended up covering two streets. Stainer Street and Weston Street are located beneath the station and are two of the darkest streets in London.\nThe London Underground station is not served by the Circle Line; it is connected to the Northern Line (via Bank) and the Jubilee Line extension."},{"id":90811,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/90811/St-Katharine-Docks\">St. Katharine Docks</a>","title":"St. Katharine Docks","tags":[{"id":391,"title":"water"},{"id":3682,"title":"dock"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Katharine_Docks","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0731586,"y":51.5081923},{"x":-0.073349,"y":51.5081322},{"x":-0.0734027,"y":51.508052},{"x":-0.0736172,"y":51.5069168},{"x":-0.0736119,"y":51.5068901},{"x":-0.0735904,"y":51.5068717},{"x":-0.0735421,"y":51.5068534},{"x":-0.0734482,"y":51.5068317},{"x":-0.0729467,"y":51.5067599},{"x":-0.0729118,"y":51.5068484},{"x":-0.0728743,"y":51.5068433},{"x":-0.0727938,"y":51.5070236},{"x":-0.0728152,"y":51.5070253},{"x":-0.0728126,"y":51.5071255},{"x":-0.0724934,"y":51.507214},{"x":-0.0724478,"y":51.5072039},{"x":-0.0723512,"y":51.5070671},{"x":-0.0726382,"y":51.5069969},{"x":-0.0726785,"y":51.5069352},{"x":-0.0726329,"y":51.5069235},{"x":-0.072657,"y":51.5067215},{"x":-0.0722439,"y":51.506663},{"x":-0.0722171,"y":51.5066847},{"x":-0.072142,"y":51.5066747},{"x":-0.0721125,"y":51.5066564},{"x":-0.0722788,"y":51.5063692},{"x":-0.0724987,"y":51.506027},{"x":-0.0725122,"y":51.5060036},{"x":-0.0725604,"y":51.5059702},{"x":-0.0726168,"y":51.5059418},{"x":-0.0726838,"y":51.5059134},{"x":-0.0719757,"y":51.5057732},{"x":-0.0720428,"y":51.5058049},{"x":-0.0720669,"y":51.50582},{"x":-0.0720911,"y":51.5058483},{"x":-0.0721206,"y":51.5058984},{"x":-0.0721742,"y":51.5059068},{"x":-0.0722788,"y":51.5059402},{"x":-0.0723056,"y":51.5059552},{"x":-0.072311,"y":51.5059852},{"x":-0.0719462,"y":51.5066113},{"x":-0.071906,"y":51.5066196},{"x":-0.0710235,"y":51.5064844},{"x":-0.0709833,"y":51.5065044},{"x":-0.0707097,"y":51.5067298},{"x":-0.0708331,"y":51.5068851},{"x":-0.0708143,"y":51.5069235},{"x":-0.0706239,"y":51.5069802},{"x":-0.0705863,"y":51.5069786},{"x":-0.0705327,"y":51.5069101},{"x":-0.0705112,"y":51.5069001},{"x":-0.070479,"y":51.5068968},{"x":-0.0703798,"y":51.5069201},{"x":-0.0701706,"y":51.5069752},{"x":-0.0697924,"y":51.5065312},{"x":-0.0696958,"y":51.5065328},{"x":-0.0684969,"y":51.506845},{"x":-0.0693874,"y":51.5079352},{"x":-0.0694276,"y":51.5079535},{"x":-0.0709431,"y":51.5077933},{"x":-0.0709672,"y":51.5077699},{"x":-0.0710155,"y":51.5073075},{"x":-0.0709833,"y":51.5072891},{"x":-0.0708546,"y":51.5072807},{"x":-0.070825,"y":51.5072724},{"x":-0.0707017,"y":51.5071021},{"x":-0.0707043,"y":51.5070821},{"x":-0.0708304,"y":51.5070487},{"x":-0.0708626,"y":51.5070287},{"x":-0.0708975,"y":51.5070153},{"x":-0.0709323,"y":51.5070153},{"x":-0.0709565,"y":51.5070353},{"x":-0.0709994,"y":51.5071004},{"x":-0.0720213,"y":51.5071455},{"x":-0.072134,"y":51.5071105},{"x":-0.0721796,"y":51.5071105},{"x":-0.0722573,"y":51.5072457},{"x":-0.072252,"y":51.5072757},{"x":-0.0720213,"y":51.5073408},{"x":-0.0715184,"y":51.5073168},{"x":-0.0714688,"y":51.5077131},{"x":-0.0729038,"y":51.5081255}],"location":{"lon":-0.0710571,"lat":51.5069827,"north":51.5081923,"south":51.5057732,"east":-0.0684969,"west":-0.0736172,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231305,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"A dock surrounded by residential flats, restaurants and a Starbucks. \n\nKeen-eyed coffee drinkers will be find a large clear acrylic block on an outside wall near the Starbucks with a rather dull carving cut into it.

The Royal Mail Mount Pleasant Sorting Office (often shortened as Mount Pleasant) is the largest sorting office operated by Royal Mail in London, England.\nIt is located in the Mount Pleasant area in Clerkenwell (EC1), at the junction between Farringdon Road and Rosebery Avenue and opposite Exmouth Market.\n\nIt was officially opened on 30 August 1889 when the Post Office Sites Act was passed by Parliament. It was built on the location of the former Coldbath Fields Prison, that ceased to function in 1885. The original prison gate was incorporated into the post office and not demolished until 1901. The remaining sections of the prison were demolished in 1929, when the new wing was built as an extension to the Letter Office. At the beginning of the 20th Century, Mount Pleasant was being referred to as \"probably the largest sorting office in the world\". At one point all mail sent to or from London came through Mount Pleasant.\n\nFrom 1927 to 2003 Mount Pleasant was connected to other major Royal Mail offices and railways stations in London via the London Post Office Railway. In the 1970s, it pioneered the use of Optical Character Recognition for sorting purposes with the installation of a machine in 1979.\n\nMount Pleasant hosts the British Postal Museum & Archive, located in Freeling House on the back of the sorting office.\n\nStation on the mailrail network - http://www.mailrail.co.uk/\n\nAddress:\nFarringdon Road,\nClerkenwell,\nLondon EC1A 1BB, EC1R 4SQ

the middle of the Roman town, the Forum was the largest marketplace building north of the Alps, measuring an almost perfect square 168 x 167 m. Two main building phases have been distinguished. The early forum, built after the time of the rebellion of Boudicca, had an open courtyard and several shops around it. The identification of this building as a forum has been disputed, and it has been argued that these were merely large warehouses. At the beginning of the second century the complex was significantly enlarged. The forum still had an open courtyard with shops around, but also a large Basilica.

It acquired its name after the dues and profits from the docks were dedicated to the wife of Henry I, Queen Matilda. The area probably began life as a Roman dock, but was known in Saxon times as Aedereshyd. Indeed, \nit contains the remains of some Roman baths. With the oldest and possibly the only extant Saxon harbour in the world, the area has always been known as a trade centre, used extensively until the 20th century by the corn and later the fur and tea trades. \n\nFurs, particularly coney skins, were a major import to the area and the nearby Skinners Lane stands as a reminder of this now departed trade.\n\n"},{"id":18917493,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18917493/Nelson-Square-Gardens\">Nelson Square Gardens</a>","title":"Nelson Square Gardens","tags":[{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.102632,"y":51.5036004},{"x":-0.102514,"y":51.5034669},{"x":-0.1025033,"y":51.5033199},{"x":-0.1020634,"y":51.5033066},{"x":-0.1020741,"y":51.502946},{"x":-0.1025033,"y":51.5029259},{"x":-0.1025569,"y":51.5024384},{"x":-0.1018274,"y":51.5025119},{"x":-0.1016986,"y":51.5022714},{"x":-0.1041126,"y":51.5019575},{"x":-0.1041019,"y":51.5022581},{"x":-0.104531,"y":51.5022647},{"x":-0.1044667,"y":51.5036271}],"location":{"lon":-0.1031148,"lat":51.5027923,"north":51.5036271,"south":51.5019575,"east":-0.1016986,"west":-0.104531,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":""},{"id":19113529,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/19113529/Granby-Estate\">Granby Estate</a>","title":"Granby Estate","tags":[{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0702202,"y":51.5254934},{"x":-0.0699091,"y":51.524165},{"x":-0.067699,"y":51.5243386},{"x":-0.068053,"y":51.5259607}],"location":{"lon":-0.0689596,"lat":51.5250628,"north":51.5259607,"south":51.524165,"east":-0.067699,"west":-0.0702202,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231451,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":""},{"id":13449540,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/13449540/Golden-Lane-Housing-Estate\">Golden Lane Housing Estate</a>","title":"Golden Lane Housing Estate","tags":[{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.096648,"y":51.523121},{"x":-0.096412,"y":51.5227614},{"x":-0.095205,"y":51.5230201},{"x":-0.094639,"y":51.5220404},{"x":-0.0953753,"y":51.5217701},{"x":-0.0959976,"y":51.5216299},{"x":-0.0961572,"y":51.5216316},{"x":-0.0967526,"y":51.5216149},{"x":-0.0972837,"y":51.5215782},{"x":-0.0973025,"y":51.5217125},{"x":-0.0973186,"y":51.5219353},{"x":-0.0973521,"y":51.5220413},{"x":-0.0974258,"y":51.5222566},{"x":-0.0975278,"y":51.5224201},{"x":-0.0976605,"y":51.5226004},{"x":-0.0978764,"y":51.5228557}],"location":{"lon":-0.0962577,"lat":51.5223496,"north":51.523121,"south":51.5215782,"east":-0.094639,"west":-0.0978764,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231452,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"It was designed by Chamberlain, Powell and Bon, the same architects who designed the Barbican estate directly to the south of it.

It closed in 1986 and was demolished. It is the only central London railway terminus to have closed without a direct replacement.\n\nOriginally it was the terminus of suburban services on the North London Line. The line originally went to Shoreditch, Haggerston and Dalston Junction, where it went both ways down the Northern London Line to a variety of places including Richmond, Stratford and Poplar.\n\nHowever, the station lost out to competition with the Underground and other public transport along with bomb damage causing half of the trainsheds to be removed, and several of its 9 platforms were taken out of use and were left to overgrow. The service deterioted and the infamous 1960s Beeching Axe asked for closure. Luckilly, locals managed to give it a reprieve but it was no use: BR had a dead man walking. The number of platforms reduced to two and finally one, before the station finally closed in 1986.\n\nLondon Overground will reopen Dalston Junction, Haggerston and build a new Shoreditch station and also make a new station on it called Hoxton, but Broad Street will not reopen and the services will divert to Whitechapel.\n\nDate opened:  \t1.11.1865\nLocation: \tAdjacent to Liverpool Street Station, on the north side of Liverpool Street opposite the junction with Old Broad Street.\nCompany on opening: \tNorth London Railway\nDate closed to passengers: \t30.6.1986\nDate closed completely:

Bartholomew's Hospital, also known as Barts, is a hospital in Smithfield in the City of London, England. It was founded in 1123 by Raherus or Rahere (died 1144, and entombed in the near by priory church of St Bartholomew-the-Great), a favourite courtier of King Henry I. Following the dissolution of the monasteries which, although did not affect the running of Barts as a hospital, left in it a procarious position by removing its only income, it was refounded by Henry VIII in December 1546, on the signing of an agreement granting the hospital to the City of London, which was reaffirmed in the Letters Patent of January 1547 endowing it with properties and income. The hospital became legally known as the 'House of the Poore in West Smithfield in the suburbs of the City of London of Henry VIII’s Foundation', although the title was never used by the general public. Upon the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948, it officially became known as St. Bartholomew’s Hospital.\n\n's_Hospital"},{"id":14671518,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a

National Theatre on the South Bank in the London Borough of Lambeth, England is immediately east of the southern end of Waterloo Bridge. The National Theatre's building was designed by architect Sir Denys Lasdun and its theatres opened individually between 1976 and 1977. In the years from 1963, before the company's permanent home on the South Bank was completed, the National Theatre Company, as it was then usually termed, was based at the Old Vic theatre in Waterloo.\n\nThe honorific \"Royal\" was added to the name in 1988, after a campaign by Max Rayne, retiring chairman of the NT board, to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the company’s inauguration (and Rayne’s own departure from office). The change was opposed by the theatre’s director, Richard Eyre, who feared that productions would become too “worthy” as a result. The addition was quietly dropped (but never officially rescinded) when Rayne retired.[1][2] Most British theatre-goers still refer to both the company and venue as The National Theatre, frequently abbreviated to \"The National\".\n\nThe National Theatre presents a highly varied programme, including Shakespeare and other classics, new plays by leading contemporary playwrights, and revivals of classic musicals. Each auditorium in the theatre can run up to three shows in repertoire or repertory, thus further widening the number of plays which can be put on during any one season.\n\nwebsite: http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/\n\nThe National Theatre London was founded between 1963 and 1976 and houses three auditoriums -

Its first site was in Bishopsgate Street (where Liverpool Street station now stands). In 1330 it became a hospital, and it admitted the mentally ill in 1357. Early sixteenth century maps show Bedlam, next to Bishopsgate, as a courtyard with a few stone buildings, a church and a garden. Conditions were consistently dreadful, and the care amounted to little more than restraint. There were 31 patients and the noise was \"so hideous, so great; that they are more able to drive a man that hath his wits rather out of them.\" Violent or dangerous patients were manacled and chained to the floor or wall. Some were allowed to leave, and licensed to beg. It was a Royal hospital, but controlled by the City of London after 1557, and managed by the Governors of Bridewell. Day to day management was in the hands of a Keeper, who received payment for each patient from their parish, livery company, or relatives. In 1598 an inspection showed neglect; the \"Great Vault\" (cesspit) badly needed emptying, and the kitchen drains needed replacing. There were 20 patients there, one of whom had been there over 25 years.\n\nBethlem Royal Hospital became famous and infamous for the brutal ill-treatment meted out to the mentally ill. In 1675 Bedlam moved to new buildings in Moorfields designed by Robert Hooke, outside the City boundary. In the 18th century people used to go there to see the lunatics. For a penny one could peer into their cells, view the freaks of the \"show of Bethlehem\" and laugh at their antics, generally of a sexual nature or violent fights. Entry was free on the first Tuesday of the month. Visitors were permitted to bring long sticks with which to poke and enrage the inmates. In 1814, there were 96,000 such visits. The lunatics were first called \"patients\" in 1700, and \"curable\" and \"incurable\" wards were opened in 1725-34.\n\nEighteenth century Bethlem was most notably portrayed in a scene from William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress (1735), the story of a rich merchant's son whose immoral living causes him to end up in a ward at Bethlem. This reflects the view of the time that madness was a result of moral weakness, leading to 'moral insanity' to be used as a common diagnosis.\n\nIn 1815, Bedlam was moved to St George's Fields, Southwark (into buildings - designed by Sydney Smirke - now used to house the Imperial War Museum), where the inmates were referred to as \"unfortunates.\" This building had a remarkable library as an annexe which was well frequented. Although the sexes were separated, in the evenings, those capable of appreciating music could dance together in the great ballroom. In the chapel the sexes were separated by a curtain. Finally, in 1930, the hospital was moved to an outer suburb of London, on the site of Monks Orchard House between Eden Park, Beckenham and Shirley.\n\nIn the early modern period it was widely believed that patients discharged from Bethlem Hospital were licensed to beg, though in 1675 the Governors denied this[1]. They were known as Abraham-men or Tom o' Bedlam. They usually wore a tin plate on their arm as a badge and were also known as Bedlamers, Bedlamites, or Bedlam Beggars. In William Shakespeare's King Lear, the Earl of Gloucester's son Edgar takes the role of a Bedlam Beggar in order to remain in England unnoticed after banishment. Whether any were ever licensed is uncertain. There were probably far more who claimed falsely to have been inmates than were ever admitted to the hospital."},{"id":30575882,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/30575882/Site-of-the-Priory-of-Holy-Trinity-Aldgate\">Site of the Priory of Holy Trinity Aldgate</a>","title":"Site of the Priory of Holy Trinity Aldgate","tags":null,"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Trinity_Priory,_Aldgate","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0792029,"y":51.5134681},{"x":-0.0791439,"y":51.5137452},{"x":-0.0790527,"y":51.5138955},{"x":-0.0783661,"y":51.5144363},{"x":-0.0775561,"y":51.5140457},{"x":-0.0768909,"y":51.5135883},{"x":-0.0777545,"y":51.5131477},{"x":-0.0783768,"y":51.5132645},{"x":-0.0792297,"y":51.5133212}],"location":{"lon":-0.0780603,"lat":51.513792,"north":51.5144363,"south":51.5131477,"east":-0.0768909,"west":-0.0792297,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":null},{"id":19047196,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/19047196/Bevin-Court-Estate\">Bevin Court Estate</a>","title":"Bevin Court Estate","tags":[{"id":45057,"title":"residential neighbourhood"},{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1137042,"y":51.5307622},{"x":-0.1134279,"y":51.5308582},{"x":-0.1125669,"y":51.530723},{"x":-0.1124247,"y":51.5307414},{"x":-0.1122638,"y":51.5303776},{"x":-0.1124838,"y":51.5300622},{"x":-0.112591,"y":51.5298887},{"x":-0.1133635,"y":51.5297235},{"x":-0.1133528,"y":51.5297018},{"x":-0.1135808,"y":51.5295817},{"x":-0.1134896,"y":51.5294115},{"x":-0.1138249,"y":51.5293381},{"x":-0.1138624,"y":51.5293798},{"x":-0.1139053,"y":51.5294115},{"x":-0.1139616,"y":51.5294398},{"x":-0.1140314,"y":51.5294665},{"x":-0.1141119,"y":51.5294866},{"x":-0.1138396,"y":51.5299738},{"x":-0.1139818,"y":51.5302883},{"x":-0.1141346,"y":51.5305945}],"location":{"lon":-0.1131992,"lat":51.5300981,"north":51.5308582,"south":51.5293381,"east":-0.1122638,"west":-0.1141346,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":""}]
