Point is a substantial concrete and glass office building in the London Borough of Camden. Designed by Richard Seifert, it was constructed from 1963 to 1966 at a cost of £5,500,000. The 34-floor building has a height of 117 m (365 ft) and a floor area of 27,180 sq m (292,563 sq ft). For 12 years following its completion, the building remained empty. From January 18-20, 1974, homeless protesters occupied Centre Point stating that the building ought to be used to solve London's housing crisis. Since 1980, Centre Point has served as the headquarters of the Confederation of British Industry. \n\nCentre Point was refurbished during the mid to late 2000s.

It was established in Västerås, Sweden, in 1947 by Erling Persson, though at the time it only sold women's clothing, skirts, sarongs and dresses, and lingerie, camisoles and slips, and was called Hennes, Swedish for \"hers.\" In 1968, Persson acquired the premises and inventory of a Stockholm hunting equipment store named Mauritz Widforss. Included in the inventory was a supply of men's clothing, prompting Persson to expand into menswear. Accordingly, he renamed the store Hennes & Mauritz, later abbreviated to H&M. H&M has more than 1300 stores in 24 different countries and has more than 50,000 employees. Stefan Persson, Erling's son, became CEO in 1990 and Chairman of the Board in 1998.
