Foundling Museum in London tells the story of the Foundling Hospital and houses the nationally important Foundling Hospital Art Collection. The Museum examines the work of its founder Thomas Coram, the artist William Hogarth and the composer George Frideric Handel. It also illustrates how the Foundling Hospital's charity work for children is still carried on today by Coram Family. \n\nThe Foundling Museum was set up as a separate charitable organisation in 1998 . After a major building refurbishment it opened to the public as a state-of-the-art museum in June of 2004.\n\nThe museum tells the story of the Hospital... and also of the children cared for there.

London Centre occupies an imposing building in the heart of London’s West End. Situated on the north-west corner of Trafalgar Square, it is adjacent to the National Gallery and the National Portrait Gallery. It is also close to Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus, and the area known as Theatreland. Downing Street and the Houses of Parliament are a fifteen-minute walk to the south, Buckingham Palace is a ten-minute walk to the west, and legal London is a similar distance down the Strand to the east. Open spaces such as St James’s Park, Waterloo Gardens, Embankment Gardens, and the River Thames are close by. Many of London’s leading universities, including King’s College London, the London School of Economics, and University College London, are nearby, and Bloomsbury (the heartland of academic life in London) is within easy walking distance. Numerous libraries are near at hand, and the area is well provided for in terms of bookshops.\n\nThe London Centre provides some 27,000 square feet of useable space for academic purposes and includes among its facilities libraries, computer laboratories, a gym, a squash court, a chapel, and numerous classrooms equipped with the latest IT equipment. The London Centre is thus able to accommodate a number of academic programs throughout the year, including the London Undergraduate Program, the Undergraduate London Summer Program, and the Engineering Summer Program.\n\nThe Notre Dame Law Centre, which runs both year-long and summer programs, is equipped with its own permanent facilities in the building and is the only study abroad program to be fully accredited by the Association of American Law Schools and the American Bar Association.\n\nThe London Centre also hosts a range of academic conferences and meetings throughout the year. These functions are usually affiliated with the University of Notre Dame, although other academic, professional, and Church-related organizations who share Notre Dame’s broader mission are also encouraged to use the facility. \n\nNotre Dame would like to invite more faculty members to get to know our Suffolk Street facility, by organizing and hosting academic conferences in this \"satellite campus\" in the heart of London. Support for conference organization is readily available on campus to launch this process, through the help of the Director of Academic Conferences, Ms. Harriet Baldwin (hbaldwin@nd.edu). For more information, click here: http://www.nd.edu/~acadconf/ \n\nIn furthering Notre Dame’s ambition to have a truly global presence, the London Centre is committed to developing activities that will raise the profile of the University in Europe and promote its interests to the wider world."},{"id":21907509,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

Arch is a London Underground station in the City of Westminster. The station is between Lancaster Gate and Bond Street stations on the Central Line, and is in Travelcard Zone 1.\n\nThe station was opened on 30 July 1900 by the Central London Railway (CLR).\n\nLike all the original stations on the CLR, Marble Arch was served by lifts to the platforms but the station was reconstructed in the early 1930s to accommodate escalators. This saw the closure of the original station building, designed by the architect Harry Bell Measures, that was situated on the corner of Quebec Street and Oxford Street, and a replacement sub-surface ticket hall opened further to the west. The new arrangements came into use on 15 August 1932. The original surface building was later demolished.\n\nDuring The Blitz, on 17 September 1940, a bomb hit the station and 20 people using it as an air-raid shelter were killed."},{"id":1132109,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1132109/Gymbox-Boxing-Club-Holborn\">Gymbox Boxing Club,
