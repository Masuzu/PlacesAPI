This is an old fashioned shop format that was widespread until about the 1960s but is now rarely seen in the UK (another example is the builders' merchants two doors down the road).  One benefit of this format is that as things don't have to be particularly clearly or well laid out, they can fit a surprisingly wide stock in a small high street shop unit with only two floors.
