The executions were public spectacles and proved extremely popular, attracting crowds of thousands. John Austin, a highwayman, was the last man hanged here in 1783.

death of Cass Elliot, singer in The Mamas and the Papas (19 September 1941 - 29 July 1974)\n\nAt the height of her solo career in 1974, Elliot performed two weeks of sold-out concerts at the London Palladium. She telephoned Michelle Phillips after the final concert on July 24th, utterly elated that she had received standing ovations each night. She then retired for the evening, and died in her sleep. She was 32. Although some sources claim her death was due to a heart attack or heart failure, her death certificate attributes death to \"fatty myocardial degeneration due to obesity\", a form of steatosis.\n\n\nThe death of Keith Moon, drummer in The Who (23 August 1946 – 7 September 1978)\n\nMoon was Paul McCartney's guest at a film preview of The Buddy Holly Story on the evening of 6 September 1978. After dining with Paul and Linda McCartney at Peppermint Park in Covent Garden, Moon and his girlfriend, Annette Walter-Lax, returned to a flat on loan from Harry Nilsson, No.12 at 9 Curzon Place, Mayfair in which Cass Elliot had died a little under four years earlier. Moon then took 32 tablets of Clomethiazole (Heminevrin). The medication was a sedative he had been prescribed to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms as he tried to go dry on his own at home; he was desperate to get clean, but was terrified of another stay in the psychiatric hospital for in-patient detoxification. However, Clomethiazole is specifically contraindicated for unsupervised home detox because of its addictiveness, tendency to rapidly induce drug tolerance and dangerously high risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were also prescribed by a new doctor, Dr. Geoffrey Dymond, who was unaware of Moon's recklessly impulsive nature and long history of prescription sedative abuse. He had given Moon a full bottle of 100 pills, and instructed him to take one whenever he felt a craving for alcohol (but not more than 3 per day). The police determined there were 32 pills in his system, with the digestion of 6 being sufficient to cause his death, and the other 26 of which were still undissolved when he died. Moon was found by Annette in bed with one hand on the floor and one leg as well. Moon may have known he was dying and tried to get help himself.\n\nHarry Nilsson who owned the flat was so distraught over the deaths of his two friends that he sold it to Moon's bandmate Pete Townshend and spent the rest of his life in Los Angeles.\n\nPhoto Source:
