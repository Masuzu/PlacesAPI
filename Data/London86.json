The station, which is within walking distance of Euston railway station, is on the Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan lines, between Great Portland Street and King's Cross St. Pancras. It is in Zone 1 of the underground.\n\nThe station was built as \"Gower Street\", changing to its present name in 1909. In late 2006 the new entrance on the south side of Euston Road opened in a corner of the new headquarters of the Wellcome Trust replacing the old entrance.\n\nIn December 2005 Network Rail announced plans to create a subway link between the station and Euston station as part of the re-development of Euston station. This will create a direct link for users of heavy rail services which terminate at Euston.\n\nBoth Warren Street and Euston tube stations are within close walking

Majesty's Theatre is the second oldest theatre still in use today in London, and dates back to 1705. The present building was constructed in 1897 by Herbert Beerbohm Tree who lived inside the building until his death in 1917. World War I smash Chu Chin Chow played for five years from 1916 which was a new record at the time. Since then, popular musicals have been staged at Her Majesty's including West Side Story, Fiddler on the Roof and The Phantom of the Opera, which opened in 1986 and is still going today.\n\nhttp://www.reallyuseful.com/theatres/her-majestys-theatre\nhttp://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/HerMajestysTheatre.htm\n\nhttp://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=51.508246~-0.131792&style=o&lvl=2&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=12487757&encType=1\n\n65 Drury Lane,\nLondon WC2B 5SP"},{"id":21907144,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/21907144/Institute-of-Archaeology\">Institute of Archaeology </a>","title":"Institute of Archaeology ","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1321846,"y":51.5250078},{"x":-0.1318836,"y":51.5247203},{"x":-0.1312157,"y":51.5250165},{"x":-0.1313042,"y":51.5250933},{"x":-0.1314772,"y":51.5250174},{"x":-0.1314947,"y":51.5250332},{"x":-0.1317796,"y":51.524916},{"x":-0.1319754,"y":51.5250912}],"location":{"lon":-0.1317002,"lat":51.5249068,"north":51.5250933,"south":51.5247203,"east":-0.1312157,"west":-0.1321846,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":null},{"id":1268933,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/1268933/London-Marriott-Hotel-Park-Lane\">London Marriott Hotel Park Lane</a>","title":"London Marriott Hotel Park Lane","tags":[{"id":17,"title":"store / shop"},{"id":50,"title":"hotel"},{"id":74,"title":"restaurant"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_London_Park_Lane","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1581484,"y":51.5132721},{"x":-0.1581417,"y":51.5132554},{"x":-0.1579365,"y":51.5128482},{"x":-0.1578748,"y":51.5128148},{"x":-0.1576683,"y":51.512849},{"x":-0.1578587,"y":51.5133473},{"x":-0.1580693,"y":51.5133247},{"x":-0.1580974,"y":51.5133189},{"x":-0.1581243,"y":51.5133072},{"x":-0.158143,"y":51.5132888}],"location":{"lon":-0.1579084,"lat":51.513081,"north":51.5133473,"south":51.5128148,"east":-0.1576683,"west":-0.1581484,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/lonpl-london-marriott-hotel-park-lane/\n\nThe Marriott London Park Lane is a luxury five-star hotel at Mayfair in the City of Westminster, London.

In 1954 the Prince Edward was transformed into a cinema, hosting the popular films of the time including 2001: A Space Odyssey for a full year! In 1978 the theatre finally began hosting musicals and plays, with shows such as Evita, Mary Poppins, Jersey Boys and ABBA musical Mamma Mia! becoming successful.\n\nhttp://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/PrinceEdwardTheatre.htm\n\nhttp://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&cp=51.513525~-0.130681&style=o&lvl=2&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&scene=15559192&encType=1"},{"id":16449969,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/16449969/Jubilee-Market-Hall\">Jubilee Market Hall</a>","title":"Jubilee Market Hall","tags":[{"id":1507,"title":"marketplace"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1223195,"y":51.5116605},{"x":-0.1219761,"y":51.5113667},{"x":-0.1223168,"y":51.5112198},{"x":-0.1226413,"y":51.5115269}],"location":{"lon":-0.1223087,"lat":51.5114401,"north":51.5116605,"south":51.5112198,"east":-0.1219761,"west":-0.1226413,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":""},{"id":3799918,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/3799918/Endsleigh-Court\">Endsleigh Court</a>","title":"Endsleigh Court","tags":[{"id":50,"title":"hotel"},{"id":2274,"title":"studio"},{"id":44865,"title":"apartment building"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1302829,"y":51.5261643},{"x":-0.1301944,"y":51.5260758},{"x":-0.1299316,"y":51.5261776},{"x":-0.1298001,"y":51.5260641},{"x":-0.1300469,"y":51.525964},{"x":-0.129953,"y":51.5258706},{"x":-0.1296821,"y":51.5259907},{"x":-0.129599,"y":51.5259206},{"x":-0.1294836,"y":51.5259623},{"x":-0.1299664,"y":51.5263912},{"x":-0.1300871,"y":51.5263412},{"x":-0.1300067,"y":51.5262677}],"location":{"lon":-0.1298833,"lat":51.5261309,"north":51.5263912,"south":51.5258706,"east":-0.1294836,"west":-0.1302829,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Nice accomodation"},{"id":9721461,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/9721461/Attorney-General-Office\">Attorney General Office</a>","title":"Attorney General Office","tags":[{"id":198,"title":"government"},{"id":1869,"title":"attorney"},{"id":14813,"title":"judiciary"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General_of_the_United_Kingdom","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1319177,"y":51.4987492},{"x":-0.1320156,"y":51.4988511},{"x":-0.1319097,"y":51.4988878},{"x":-0.1319459,"y":51.4989254},{"x":-0.1318708,"y":51.4989512},{"x":-0.1318158,"y":51.4988928},{"x":-0.1317675,"y":51.4989095},{"x":-0.1318011,"y":51.4989446},{"x":-0.1311091,"y":51.4991992},{"x":-0.1310715,"y":51.49916},{"x":-0.1309964,"y":51.4991892},{"x":-0.130924,"y":51.4991157}],"location":{"lon":-0.1314698,"lat":51.4989742,"north":51.4991992,"south":51.4987492,"east":-0.130924,"west":-0.1320156,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Her Majesty's Attorney General for England and Wales, usually known simply as the Attorney General, is the chief legal adviser of the Crown in England and Wales.
