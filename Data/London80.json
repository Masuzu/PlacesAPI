London terminus of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) - express trains to Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Glasgow depart from here, as do the overnight trains to Scotland.  Commuter services as far as Milton Keynes and Northampton depart from here also, as well as the London Overground to Watford.\n\nThis is the second Euston station to stand on this site - the 1830s original was controversially demolished in the mid 1960s and rebuilt to a design by BR's own faceless architects in collaboration with that rather more famous London vandal - Sir Richard Seifert.  The intention was to symbolise the electrification of the WCML with a new glass and concrete structure.  The 1960s building has never been popular with either the public or architectural critics, and is frequently derided as one of the worst main line stations in Britain - topped only by Birmingham New Street.  The trainshed is particularly grim, which has the same ambience as a multi-storey car park largely due to the large (and largely redundant) Royal Mail parcels depot that is built over the top of it.\n\nVarious schemes to replace it have been touted, but none has hitherto managed to get off the drawing board.  A stay of execution was granted in September 2011, when it was announced that Network Rail was forced to overhaul its original plan after Euston was selected as the terminus for the controversial High Speed 2.  With these plans not due to become reality until 2026, it appears that the existing station will be with us for a long time yet!\n\nHowever, it has been recently redeveloped to move the shops out to the bleak and windswept plaza at the front, which have been repaved.\nhttp://www.nationalrail.co.uk/stations/EUS.html"},{"id":25673298,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/25673298/Site-of-the-Palace-of-Whitehall\">Site of the Palace of Whitehall</a>","title":"Site of the Palace of Whitehall","tags":[{"id":45694,"title":"historical layer / disappeared object"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1274633,"y":51.5054656},{"x":-0.1269323,"y":51.5042502},{"x":-0.1272756,"y":51.5041701},{"x":-0.1271683,"y":51.5040231},{"x":-0.1273614,"y":51.5039964},{"x":-0.1273185,"y":51.5038361},{"x":-0.1275116,"y":51.5038094},{"x":-0.1274687,"y":51.5034622},{"x":-0.1267606,"y":51.5033954},{"x":-0.1267606,"y":51.5033018},{"x":-0.1264386,"y":51.5032618},{"x":-0.1263958,"y":51.5031683},{"x":-0.1263529,"y":51.503155},{"x":-0.1263636,"y":51.5042235},{"x":-0.1252049,"y":51.504337},{"x":-0.1250976,"y":51.5030014},{"x":-0.1261383,"y":51.5029011},{"x":-0.126074,"y":51.5025806},{"x":-0.1249367,"y":51.5024337},{"x":-0.1242501,"y":51.5050115},{"x":-0.1244432,"y":51.5050249},{"x":-0.1242286,"y":51.50608},{"x":-0.1239282,"y":51.5061334},{"x":-0.1239711,"y":51.5063338},{"x":-0.124808,"y":51.5068146},{"x":-0.1256126,"y":51.5065073},{"x":-0.126074,"y":51.5066409},{"x":-0.126428,"y":51.5064807},{"x":-0.1268089,"y":51.5063504},{"x":-0.1260096,"y":51.5043838},{"x":-0.1264602,"y":51.5043303},{"x":-0.1269108,"y":51.5055458}],"location":{"lon":-0.1257199,"lat":51.5046241,"north":51.5068146,"south":51.5024337,"east":-0.1239282,"west":-0.1275116,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"Built in 1240 as York Place as a London home for the Archbishops of York, it was appropriated by Henry VIII in 1530 when it was renamed Whitehall and greatly expanded eventually becoming the largest palace in Europe.

Numerous convicts were hanged at the gallows for as little as stealing clothes at a village which was located here. These became popular events. Many people hoped public hangings would discourage crime; infact pickpockets took advantage to steal from people when everyone was focussed on the gallows and eventually these ended.\n\nJohn Austin, a highwayman, was the last condemned man to be hanged there in 1783.\n\nThe penalty of death for murder was abolished in England in 1965 by the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965. In 1999, the British government ratified the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and so totally abolished capital punishment in the UK."},{"id":26384398,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/26384398/Southbank-Centre\">Southbank Centre</a>","title":"Southbank Centre","tags":[{"id":613,"title":"cinema"},{"id":44875,"title":"arts centre"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southbank_Centre","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1138973,"y":51.507861},{"x":-0.1127386,"y":51.5067124},{"x":-0.1142836,"y":51.5063251},{"x":-0.115056,"y":51.5060046},{"x":-0.1164937,"y":51.5053234},{"x":-0.1179743,"y":51.5058042},{"x":-0.1172233,"y":51.5065121},{"x":-0.1158285,"y":51.5073535}],"location":{"lon":-0.1153565,"lat":51.5065922,"north":51.507861,"south":51.5053234,"east":-0.1127386,"west":-0.1179743,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":15},"description":"Southbank Centre is a complex of artistic venues in London, UK, on the South Bank of the River Thames between County Hall and Waterloo Bridge.

Its collections, which number more than seven million objects, are amongst the largest and most comprehensive in the world and originate from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginning to the present.\nThe British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759 in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum (Natural History) in South Kensington in 1887. Some objects in the collection, most notably the Elgin Marbles from the Parthenon, are the objects of intense controversy and calls for restitution to their countries of origin.\nhttp://www.britishmuseum.org\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHX-54fvUbk"},{"id":9629671,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/9629671/Aldwych\">Aldwych</a>","title":"Aldwych","tags":[{"id":46051,"title":"road junction"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldwych","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1159197,"y":51.5132663},{"x":-0.1156046,"y":51.5132127},{"x":-0.1153336,"y":51.5131186},{"x":-0.1150547,"y":51.5130309},{"x":-0.1149542,"y":51.5130007},{"x":-0.1149193,"y":51.512984},{"x":-0.1148871,"y":51.5129582},{"x":-0.114867,"y":51.5129356},{"x":-0.114855,"y":51.5129106},{"x":-0.1148576,"y":51.5128782},{"x":-0.1148737,"y":51.5128231},{"x":-0.1148979,"y":51.5127754},{"x":-0.1149234,"y":51.5127487},{"x":-0.1149569,"y":51.5127236},{"x":-0.1150052,"y":51.5127003},{"x":-0.1150494,"y":51.5126777},{"x":-0.1151165,"y":51.5126552},{"x":-0.1154182,"y":51.5125694},{"x":-0.1156596,"y":51.512495},{"x":-0.1158219,"y":51.5124424},{"x":-0.1160431,"y":51.5123566},{"x":-0.1162537,"y":51.5122654},{"x":-0.1165018,"y":51.5121644},{"x":-0.1166856,"y":51.5121094},{"x":-0.1169174,"y":51.5120327},{"x":-0.1171281,"y":51.5119658},{"x":-0.1172824,"y":51.5119266},{"x":-0.1175076,"y":51.5118817},{"x":-0.1178335,"y":51.5117848},{"x":-0.1179824,"y":51.5117329},{"x":-0.1182855,"y":51.5116261},{"x":-0.1187495,"y":51.5114575},{"x":-0.1188072,"y":51.5115168},{"x":-0.1188674,"y":51.5115928},{"x":-0.1189198,"y":51.5116395},{"x":-0.1189668,"y":51.5116687},{"x":-0.1190459,"y":51.5116995},{"x":-0.1190325,"y":51.5118239},{"x":-0.1189963,"y":51.5119766},{"x":-0.1189735,"y":51.5120601},{"x":-0.1189413,"y":51.5121494},{"x":-0.1189185,"y":51.512197},{"x":-0.1188648,"y":51.5122856},{"x":-0.1187802,"y":51.5124},{"x":-0.1187147,"y":51.5124816},{"x":-0.1186664,"y":51.512545},{"x":-0.1185846,"y":51.5126268},{"x":-0.1185375,"y":51.512682},{"x":-0.1184183,"y":51.512767},{"x":-0.1183338,"y":51.5128388},{"x":-0.1182801,"y":51.5128724},{"x":-0.1181943,"y":51.5129198},{"x":-0.1181232,"y":51.5129623},{"x":-0.1180535,"y":51.5130041},{"x":-0.117997,"y":51.5130318},{"x":-0.1178309,"y":51.5130934},{"x":-0.1177008,"y":51.5131451},{"x":-0.1176162,"y":51.5131636},{"x":-0.1174687,"y":51.5132021},{"x":-0.1173306,"y":51.5132294},{"x":-0.1171751,"y":51.5132603},{"x":-0.1170248,"y":51.5132788},{"x":-0.1167285,"y":51.513307},{"x":-0.1165179,"y":51.513313},{"x":-0.1162457,"y":51.5133079},{"x":-0.1160271,"y":51.5132862}],"location":{"lon":-0.1169505,"lat":51.5123852,"north":51.513313,"south":51.5114575,"east":-0.114855,"west":-0.1190459,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"A crescent shaped junction between the Strand, Kingsway and Waterloo Bridge, with several buildings within it.

Famous Shopping.  Oxford Street is a green property (£300) on the London monopoly board game. Other green properties are Regent Street and Bond Street.  US equivalent property in Atlantic City is North Carolina Avenue.\n\nOxford Street is a major thoroughfare in London, England in the City of Westminster. With over 300 shops, it is probably the world's largest shopping street.\n\nIt runs for approximately a mile and a half from Marble Arch at the north east corner of Hyde Park, through Oxford Circus to St Giles' Circus, at the intersection with Charing Cross Road and Tottenham Court Road. Eastwards, the road then becomes New Oxford Street until it runs into High Holborn. West of Marble Arch, Oxford Street becomes Bayswater Road or the A40 which continues west towards Oxford. Oxford Street intersects with other London roads including Park Lane, New Bond Street and Regent Street.\n\nHistory\nThe street follows the start of Roman roads from Wales, Gloucester, Cirencester, Oxford, Bath and Silchester via London to Colchester and became one of the major routes in and out of the city.\n\nBetween the 12th century and 1782 it was variously known as Tyburn Road (after the River Tyburn that ran just to the south of it, and now flows underneath it), Uxbridge Road, Worcester Road and Oxford Road. It became notorious as the route taken by prisoners on their final journey from Newgate Prison to the gallows at Tyburn near Marble Arch.\n\nIn the late 18th century, many of the surrounding fields were purchased by the Earl of Oxford, and the area was developed. It became popular with entertainers including tiger-baiters and masquerades. During the 19th century the area became known for its shops.\n\nMajor Oxford Street area stores \nHome to major department stores and hundreds of smaller shops. It is the major shopping street in central London, though not the most expensive or fashionable, and part of a larger shopping district with Regent Street, Bond Street and other smaller nearby streets. The other principal shopping area in central London is Knightsbridge, famous for Harrods department store.\n\nFor many British chain stores, their Oxford Street branch is regarded as their 'flagship' store and used for celebrity launches and promotions.\n\nSelfridges, a department store that has been on this site for more than a century. \nMarks and Spencer, of 170,000 square feet, on the junction of Oxford Street and Orchard Street. \nHMV, although it moved from its original location in 2000 after 80 years. HMV has three stores on the street including a concession within Selfridges and its shop at 150 Oxford Street, which is Europe's largest music shop at 50,000 square feet. \nBorders, bookshop. \nOther department stores including; John Lewis, Debenhams (historically Debenham & Freebody and Marshall & Snelgrove prior to combining following a rebuild in the 1960s when it became Debenhams) and House of Fraser (historically known as DH Evans prior to rebranding as House of Fraser in 2000). \nVirgin Megastore, at the intersection of Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road, an entertainment retailer. \nThe Disney Store \nCentred around Oxford Circus are fashion shops including Topshop. \nFrom 2007 Oxford Street has a Primark in the building that formerly housed C&A and latterly Allders. \nAdidas, a sports brand, has a store on Oxford Street opposite Selfridges. Adidas are the manufacturers of the football kit of the the London-based football team Chelsea F.C. \nThere are also a number of stores on Oxford Street which operate on short term leases in empty retail units and advertise themselves as Closing Down Sales. However in some cases these Closing Down Sales can exhibit rather a long term or even permanent presence.\nOxford Street can become congested both on the footpath and on the road due to the number of buses which use the street and the high number of shoppers and tourists on the street. Common sights on Oxford Street include preachers (such as Philip Howard who was at Oxford Circus), political demonstrations (such as the 2001 May Day protests and small scale protests) and Hare Krishnas.\n\nChristmas lights\nEach Christmas the street is decorated with festive lights. In mid-to-late November a celebrity turns on the lights and they remain on until January 6.\n\nThe use of Christmas lights began in 1959, five years after its neighbour Regent Street had begun the tradition. In 1967, as the recession hit London, the lights were stopped and only returned in 1978 when Oxford Street organised a laser display.\n\nCelebrities who turned on the Christmas lights\n2006 — All Saints (& Peter Andre & Katie Price aka Jordan, G4, Andy Abraham) \n2005 — Westlife \n2004 — Steve Redgrave, Emma Watson \n2003 — Enrique Iglesias \n2002 — Blue \n2001 — S Club 7 \n2000 — Charlotte Church \n1999 — Ronan Keating \n1998 — Zoë Ball \n1997 — Peter Andre \n1996 — Spice Girls \n1995 — Coronation Street Cast \n1994 — Lenny Henry \n1993 — Richard Branson \n1992 — Linford Christie \n1991 — Westminster Children's Hospital \n1990 — Cliff Richard \n1989 — Gorden Kaye \n1988 — Terry Wogan \n1987 — Derek Jameson \n1986 — Leslie Grantham, Anita Dobson (Den and Angie Watts from Eastenders) \n1985 — Bob Geldof \n1984 — Esther Rantzen \n1983 — Pat Phoenix \n1982 — Daley Thompson \n1981 — Pilin Leon (Miss World, Venezuela) \n\nTransport\n \nOxford Street is served by the Central, Jubilee,

It was founded by American entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge who opened a large store in London's Oxford Street on 15 March 1909.\n\nH. Gordon Selfridge was born in 1858 in Ripon, Wisconsin, and in 1879 joined Field, Leiter and Company (later to become Marshall Field & Company), where he worked under the Chicago retailer of the same name. He worked his way up through the firm, married into the prominent Buckingham family, and amassed the fortune with which he built his new London store.\n\nSelfridge's innovative marketing led to his success. He tried to make shopping a fun adventure instead of a chore. He put merchandise on display so customers could examine it, put the highly profitable perfume counter front-and-center on the ground floor, and established policies that made it safe and easy for customers to shop — techniques that have been adopted by modern department stores the world over.\n\nSelfridge is popularly held to have coined the phrase \"the customer is always right\", and he did use it regularly in his extensive advertising. The phrase, however, predated Selfridge by centuries; he may have assimilated it while purchasing Persian rugs in Mumbai.\n\nHe attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits. He was himself interested in education and science, and believed that the displays would introduce potential new customers to Selfridges, generating both immediate and long-term sales.\n\nIn 1909, after the first cross-Channel flight, Louis Blériot's monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges, where it was seen by 12,000 people. The first public demonstration of television was by John Logie Baird from the first floor of Selfridges from 1-27 April 1925.\n\nA Milne-Shaw seismograph was set up on the Selfridge store’s third floor in 1932, attached to one of the building's main stanchions, unaffected by traffic or shoppers. It recorded the Belgian earthquake of 11 June 1938 which was also felt in London. At the outbreak of war, the seismograph was moved from its original site near the Post Office to another part of the store. In 1947, the seismograph was given to the British Museum.\n\nThe provincial stores were sold to the John Lewis Partnership in the 1940s. The remaining Oxford Street store was acquired in 1951 by the Liverpool-based Lewis's chain of department stores, which was in turn taken over in 1965 by the Sears group of Charles Clore.[1] Between 1998 and 2003, the store supplemented its 460,000 square-foot main store with a 150,000 square-foot outlet at Trafford Centre in Manchester, a 120,000 square-foot outlet in the Marks & Spencer building in Exchange Square, Manchester, and a 160,000 square-foot store in the Birmingham Bull Ring shopping complex.\n\nSelfridge stores are known for architectural excellence. Their main store was designed by Daniel Burnham, who also crafted Marshall Field's main store in his home town of Chicago. The London store was built in phases, the first phase consisting only of the nine-and-a-half bays closest to the Duke Street corner.[2] A scheme to erect a massive tower above the store was never carried out.[3] Also involved in the design of the store were the American architect Francis Swales, who worked on decorative details, and the British architect Frank Atkinson.[4] The 160,000 square foot Birmingham store, designed by architects Future Systems, is covered in 15,000 spun aluminium discs.\n\nIn 2003, the chain was acquired by Canada's Galen Weston for £598 million. Weston, a retailing expert who is the owner of Canada's major supermarket chains Loblaws and No Frills among others, has chosen to invest in renovation of the Oxford Street store, rather than to immediately carry out planned expansion to Leeds, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Bristol, and Glasgow.[5]\n\nAlso according to Wikipedia.com, Selfridges is the third most photographed building in the UK!"},{"id":6192,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/6192/Harrods\">Harrods</a>","title":"Harrods","tags":[{"id":44699,"title":"department store"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrods","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1630622,"y":51.4985563},{"x":-0.1631051,"y":51.4985672},{"x":-0.1631588,"y":51.4985847},{"x":-0.163368,"y":51.4986766},{"x":-0.1642598,"y":51.4991115},{"x":-0.1642746,"y":51.4991207},{"x":-0.1642853,"y":51.4991291},{"x":-0.164288,"y":51.4991391},{"x":-0.1642853,"y":51.4991483},{"x":-0.1642719,"y":51.4991608},{"x":-0.1628691,"y":51.4999497},{"x":-0.1625808,"y":51.4997978},{"x":-0.16222,"y":51.4995983},{"x":-0.1617707,"y":51.4993303},{"x":-0.1617211,"y":51.4993027},{"x":-0.1616956,"y":51.4992794},{"x":-0.1616836,"y":51.4992601},{"x":-0.1616795,"y":51.4992451},{"x":-0.1616782,"y":51.4992309},{"x":-0.1616795,"y":51.4992192},{"x":-0.1616849,"y":51.4992042},{"x":-0.1621543,"y":51.498548},{"x":-0.1621838,"y":51.4985547},{"x":-0.1621945,"y":51.4985388},{"x":-0.1622254,"y":51.4985313},{"x":-0.1622884,"y":51.4985447},{"x":-0.1627538,"y":51.4985163},{"x":-0.162861,"y":51.4985221},{"x":-0.1629388,"y":51.4985321},{"x":-0.1630059,"y":51.4985438}],"location":{"lon":-0.1629831,"lat":51.499233,"north":51.4999497,"south":51.4985163,"east":-0.1616782,"west":-0.164288,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"http://www.harrods.com/harrodsstore/\n\nHarrods department store in Brompton, London is the joint-largest department store in the world (shared with Macy's in New York) and by far the largest in the UK; the second largest in the UK(Selfridges on Oxford Street) is only a quarter of that size. It specializes in luxury goods which are sold in 330 departments.\n\nIt was founded by Charles Harrod in 1834 who opened a grocery shop in Stepney. Fifteen years later, he moved to the present site in Brompton still selling groceries, but it later began to sell more goods and expand, taking over nearby buildings. In 1883, a fire burnt it to the ground so over the next 20 years it was built to its much grander size. For some time it was owned by House of Fraser and then by the Al-Fayed family.\n\nHarrods claims to have had the first proper escalator, and often brandy was offered at the top of it to customers who found it a bit of an ordeal. There are some recent controversies over the sale of fur.

Other pink properties are Pall Mall and Northumberland Avenue.  US Atlantic City equivalent property is States Avenue.\n\nWhitehall is a road in Westminster in London, England. It is the main artery running north from Parliament Square, centre of national government, towards traditional Charing Cross, now at the southern end of Trafalgar Square and marked by the statue of Charles I, which is often regarded as the heart of London. The road is lined with government ministries; \"Whitehall\" is therefore also frequently used as a metonym for governmental administration, as well as being a geographic name for the surrounding district.\n\nThe name is taken from the vast Palace of Whitehall that used to occupy the area but which was largely destroyed by fire in 1698. Whitehall was originally a wide road that ran up to the front of the palace. Trafalgar Square was built at its northern extremity in the early 19th century. The southernmost part by Parliament Square is Parliament Street, however there is no longer any obvious distinction between the two on the ground. Combined, the streets cover a total distance of about 0.6 miles.\n \nHistory\nParliament Street was a small side road alongside the palace leading to the Palace of Westminster. When the palace was destroyed and its ruins demolished, Parliament Street was widened to match Whitehall's width. The present appearance of the street is largely the result of 19th century redevelopment.\n\nThe Banqueting House, built in 1622 by Inigo Jones, is the only surviving portion of the former palace. Charles I was executed on 30 January 1649 on a scaffold erected outside the building, stepping onto it from a first-floor window. This was during the time when Britain was a republic run by a Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Royalists still commemorate the regicide annually on the anniversary of the execution.\n\nWhitehall and the surrounding area is the administrative centre of the UK government; it is dominated by government buildings, to such an extent that the term is often used, by extension, to refer to the British Civil Service or the government itself.\n\nThe Cenotaph, the principal war memorial of Britain, is in the centre of the road, and is the site of the annual memorial ceremonies on Remembrance Sunday. In 2005 a Monument to the Women of World War II was placed just a short distance northwards from the Cenotaph.\n\nThe central portion of the street is dominated by military buildings, including the Ministry of Defence, with the former headquarters of the British Army and Royal Navy, the Horse Guards building and the Admiralty respectively, opposite. The road also hosts equestrian statues of George, Duke of Cambridge, a former Army Commander-in-Chief and Earl Haig, Commander in Chief of the British Armies in France 1915-1918.\n\nDowning Street, with the official homes of the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Privy Council rooms, leads off the south-west end of Whitehall, just above Parliament Street. It is closed to the public at both ends by imposing security gates erected in 1986. These have since been supplemented by a further gated barrier around three metres outside the main gates.\n\nScotland Yard, the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police, was originally located in Great Scotland Yard off the north-eastern end of the street, but relocated to New Scotland Yard on the Victoria Embankment in 1890.\n \nGovernment buildings in Whitehall (north to south)\nCabinet Office \nDEFRA\nOld War Office \nHorse Guards \nMinistry of Defence \nScotland Office (Dover House) \nWales Office (Gwydyr House) \nCabinet Office \n10 Downing Street\nDepartment of Health \nDepartment of Work and Pensions \nForeign Office \nHM Treasury and HM Revenue and Customs \n\nOther notable buildings in Whitehall\nBanqueting House \nCenotaph \nMonument to the Women of World War II \nWhitehall Theatre"},{"id":5949221,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/5949221/London-St-Pancras-Barlow-Trainshed\">London St Pancras - Barlow Trainshed</a>","title":"London St Pancras - Barlow Trainshed","tags":[{"id":731,"title":"railway"},{"id":1149,"title":"engineering"},{"id":44605,"title":"interesting place"},{"id":44751,"title":"train station"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1256736,"y":51.5299547},{"x":-0.1269758,"y":51.5315882},{"x":-0.126957,"y":51.5315932},{"x":-0.1269999,"y":51.53165},{"x":-0.126041,"y":51.5319403},{"x":-0.1259995,"y":51.5318836},{"x":-0.125978,"y":51.5318902},{"x":-0.1246946,"y":51.5302517},{"x":-0.1247898,"y":51.53022},{"x":-0.1248032,"y":51.5302375},{"x":-0.1248528,"y":51.5302066},{"x":-0.1249547,"y":51.5301633},{"x":-0.1250607,"y":51.5301174},{"x":-0.1251814,"y":51.530074},{"x":-0.1252954,"y":51.5300465},{"x":-0.1253933,"y":51.5300256},{"x":-0.1254992,"y":51.5300097},{"x":-0.1255985,"y":51.5299989},{"x":-0.125585,"y":51.5299805}],"location":{"lon":-0.1258473,"lat":51.5309475,"north":51.5319403,"south":51.5299547,"east":-0.1246946,"west":-0.1269999,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"Completed in 1868, this trainshed is the longest single-span iron structure in the world.

It is the closest railway station to central London, being right by the Charing Cross and Trafalgar Square. It is operated by Southeastern and Southern trains. The station was built by the SER (South Eastern Railway) when they extended their line into central London. Originally the platforms were covered by a glass roof, although it was replaced in the 1990s (now in a bit of a state) with a comercial development called Embankment Place, although this does not cover the concourse.\n\nThe Underground station is served by the Northern and Bakerloo Lines, and was made by combining two seperate stations (Trafalgar Square and Strand). On the platforms, murals depict the funeral journey of Eleanor and the building of the Charing Cross. Another tube station called Embankment is located on the same lines as well as the District and Circle Lines and is located within walking distance and this was originally called 'Charing

The street is a major thoroughfare in the St James's area of London, and a section of the regional A4 road.  \n  \nPall Mall is best known for being the home to various gentlemen's clubs built in the 19th century and early 20th centuries. These include the Athenaeum, Travellers Club, Reform Club, United Services Club, Oxford and Cambridge Club and Royal Automobile Club. It was also once the centre of the fine art scene in London; in 1814 the Royal Academy, the National Gallery and Christie's auction house were all here, but none of them stayed for long.  \n  \nThe freehold of nearly all of the southern side of the Pall Mall has belonged to the crown for several hundred years, and is still owned by the Crown Estate. St. James's Palace is on the south side of the street at the western end. Marlborough House, which was once a royal residence, is next to it to the east, opening off of a courtyard just to the south of the street. The Prince Regent's Carlton House once stood at the eastern end of the street. Pall Mall was also once the home of the War Office, with which it became synonymous (just as Whitehall refers to the administrative centre of the UK government).

First published in 1940, when it was performed in the show New Faces, it was most famously performed by Vera Lynn in the same year. She was not the first interpreter, being preceded by Ray Noble, and subsequently it has become a standard, being performed in a noteworthy fashion by Nat King Cole, Glenn Miller, Bobby Darin, Harry Connick Jr. and Sonny Rollins. A famous version by The Manhattan Transfer won a Grammy in 1981 for its arranger, Gene Puerling. Veteran British musician Ian Hunter, former vocalist for Mott the Hoople, regularly performs it in his concerts; Hunter's rendition appears on at least two of his live recordings. A performance of the song by British actor Robert Lindsay was used as the theme to the British situation comedy series Nightingales. The recording by John Le Mesurier is widely regarded as the definitive version.\n\nthe Square was originally laid out in the mid 18th century by architect William Kent. It is named after the noble Gloucestershire family of the same name whose London home, Berkeley House, had stood nearby until 1733. Berkeley Square is a mostly residential enclave inhabited almost exclusively by residents who are most likely of extremely well-to-do financial means and some even of titled or peeraged gentry. A residence in Berkeley Square is highly sought after, and residences do not come up on the market very often at all. The limited supply and great demand has created a market where a residence in Berkeley Square commands higher-than-usual prices on the realty market compared to similar residences, even in other affluent neighborhoods.\n\nThe square features a statue by Alexander Munro, a Pre-Raphaelite sculptor, made in 1858. The surrounding London Plane trees are among the oldest in central London, planted in 1789.\n\nThe buildings around the square include several by other notable architects including Robert Adam, who designed Lansdowne House (since 1935 home of the Lansdowne Club) in the south-west corner of the square.\n\n50 Berkeley Square is the most infamous haunted house in London.\n\nResidents of Berkeley Square have included:\n\nGeorge Canning, UK Prime Minister (1827) - at no. 50 \nWinston Churchill lived at no.48 as a child \nRobert Clive of India - bought no. 45 in 1761"},{"id":17899,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/17899/Gordon-Square\">Gordon Square</a>","title":"Gordon Square","tags":[{"id":194,"title":"park"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Square","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1308272,"y":51.5235776},{"x":-0.1319056,"y":51.5246227},{"x":-0.1310504,"y":51.5249607},{"x":-0.1298566,"y":51.523968}],"location":{"lon":-0.1308811,"lat":51.5242691,"north":51.5249607,"south":51.5235776,"east":-0.1298566,"west":-0.1319056,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"Key Bloomsbury site."},{"id":13839485,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/13839485/St-James-Garden\">St James Garden</a>","title":"St James Garden","tags":[{"id":194,"title":"park"},{"id":469,"title":"garden"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1377985,"y":51.5289577},{"x":-0.1366223,"y":51.5289535},{"x":-0.1365888,"y":51.528951},{"x":-0.1365633,"y":51.528941},{"x":-0.1365271,"y":51.5289176},{"x":-0.1357439,"y":51.5282226},{"x":-0.1357305,"y":51.5282059},{"x":-0.1357318,"y":51.528196},{"x":-0.1357439,"y":51.5281901},{"x":-0.1367471,"y":51.5281876},{"x":-0.1367766,"y":51.5281842},{"x":-0.1368262,"y":51.5281776},{"x":-0.1368731,"y":51.5281676},{"x":-0.136912,"y":51.5281617},{"x":-0.136967,"y":51.5281542},{"x":-0.1370126,"y":51.5281517},{"x":-0.137089,"y":51.52815},{"x":-0.1373479,"y":51.5281467},{"x":-0.1375557,"y":51.5281434},{"x":-0.1379098,"y":51.5281459},{"x":-0.1379098,"y":51.5281793},{"x":-0.1379138,"y":51.5283102},{"x":-0.1378334,"y":51.5283837},{"x":-0.1378173,"y":51.5284037},{"x":-0.1378092,"y":51.5284179},{"x":-0.1378052,"y":51.5284371},{"x":-0.1377945,"y":51.5286773}],"location":{"lon":-0.1368222,"lat":51.5285505,"north":51.5289577,"south":51.5281434,"east":-0.1357305,"west":-0.1379138,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Cardington Street,\nEuston, London\n\nThese gardens are tucked away off Cardington Street to the west of Euston station.

It’s alright to eat your sandwiches though, and there’s, surprise, surprise, a lone Thistle hotel next door with an underground bistro!\n\nSadly, the park is under threat (along with all the adjacent buildings)  if the High Speed 2 railway line comes into being, as Euston Station will be expanded westward and will swallow up everything in its path."},{"id":11424804,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/11424804/Somerset-House\">Somerset House</a>","title":"Somerset House","tags":[{"id":127,"title":"museum"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerset_House","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1181104,"y":51.5102566},{"x":-0.1181355,"y":51.5102872},{"x":-0.1181506,"y":51.5102824},{"x":-0.1182385,"y":51.5103847},{"x":-0.118223,"y":51.5103899},{"x":-0.1182526,"y":51.5104261},{"x":-0.1180521,"y":51.5104853},{"x":-0.1181641,"y":51.5106297},{"x":-0.1181828,"y":51.5106243},{"x":-0.118267,"y":51.5107407},{"x":-0.1182495,"y":51.5107453},{"x":-0.1183591,"y":51.5109027},{"x":-0.118378,"y":51.5108972},{"x":-0.1183689,"y":51.5108851},{"x":-0.1185791,"y":51.5108238},{"x":-0.1185995,"y":51.5108511},{"x":-0.1186147,"y":51.5108463},{"x":-0.1186985,"y":51.5109535},{"x":-0.1186848,"y":51.5109577},{"x":-0.1187126,"y":51.5109925},{"x":-0.1186502,"y":51.5110119},{"x":-0.1186931,"y":51.5110621},{"x":-0.1183511,"y":51.5111637},{"x":-0.1183726,"y":51.5111918},{"x":-0.1182245,"y":51.5112344},{"x":-0.1182935,"y":51.5113193},{"x":-0.1181732,"y":51.5113591},{"x":-0.1181232,"y":51.5112999},{"x":-0.1177195,"y":51.5114476},{"x":-0.1177537,"y":51.5114923},{"x":-0.1177691,"y":51.5114881},{"x":-0.117879,"y":51.5116409},{"x":-0.1173325,"y":51.5117915},{"x":-0.1172239,"y":51.511643},{"x":-0.1170368,"y":51.5116964},{"x":-0.1170442,"y":51.511706},{"x":-0.1169846,"y":51.5117231},{"x":-0.116953,"y":51.5117143},{"x":-0.1168539,"y":51.5117432},{"x":-0.1167767,"y":51.5116376},{"x":-0.1169909,"y":51.5115761},{"x":-0.1169959,"y":51.511582},{"x":-0.1172213,"y":51.5115174},{"x":-0.117297,"y":51.5116201},{"x":-0.1176957,"y":51.5115099},{"x":-0.1176149,"y":51.5114047},{"x":-0.118108,"y":51.5112607},{"x":-0.1181124,"y":51.5112663},{"x":-0.1182834,"y":51.5112151},{"x":-0.1180179,"y":51.5108518},{"x":-0.117985,"y":51.5108622},{"x":-0.1181721,"y":51.5111126},{"x":-0.1180574,"y":51.5111451},{"x":-0.1178704,"y":51.510896},{"x":-0.1177939,"y":51.5109193},{"x":-0.1179944,"y":51.5111869},{"x":-0.1177282,"y":51.5112637},{"x":-0.1172507,"y":51.510618},{"x":-0.1169932,"y":51.5106893},{"x":-0.1170007,"y":51.5106981},{"x":-0.1167485,"y":51.5107704},{"x":-0.1167385,"y":51.5107583},{"x":-0.1164494,"y":51.5108396},{"x":-0.1166452,"y":51.5111105},{"x":-0.1166607,"y":51.5111058},{"x":-0.1167378,"y":51.5112111},{"x":-0.116721,"y":51.5112173},{"x":-0.1169309,"y":51.5114907},{"x":-0.1167109,"y":51.5115537},{"x":-0.1162201,"y":51.5108926},{"x":-0.1162007,"y":51.5108981},{"x":-0.1161618,"y":51.510848},{"x":-0.1156904,"y":51.5109811},{"x":-0.1156337,"y":51.5109},{"x":-0.1157121,"y":51.5108778},{"x":-0.1157031,"y":51.5108655},{"x":-0.1159318,"y":51.5108029},{"x":-0.1159402,"y":51.5108135},{"x":-0.1160995,"y":51.5107696},{"x":-0.1160827,"y":51.510747},{"x":-0.1162644,"y":51.5106969},{"x":-0.1162737,"y":51.5107099},{"x":-0.1166318,"y":51.5106138},{"x":-0.1166245,"y":51.5106043},{"x":-0.1169061,"y":51.510525},{"x":-0.1169216,"y":51.5105446},{"x":-0.1172756,"y":51.5104442},{"x":-0.1172682,"y":51.5104336},{"x":-0.117411,"y":51.5103939},{"x":-0.1174197,"y":51.5104051},{"x":-0.1174358,"y":51.510401},{"x":-0.1175183,"y":51.5105153},{"x":-0.1175006,"y":51.5105204},{"x":-0.1176806,"y":51.5107666},{"x":-0.1179033,"y":51.510704},{"x":-0.1177282,"y":51.5104544},{"x":-0.1177034,"y":51.5104613},{"x":-0.1176682,"y":51.5104145},{"x":-0.1176065,"y":51.5104325},{"x":-0.1175964,"y":51.5104196},{"x":-0.117474,"y":51.5104535},{"x":-0.1174385,"y":51.5104002},{"x":-0.1176316,"y":51.5103451},{"x":-0.1176222,"y":51.5103329},{"x":-0.1177671,"y":51.5102905},{"x":-0.1177759,"y":51.5103016},{"x":-0.1178811,"y":51.510272},{"x":-0.1179146,"y":51.510315}],"location":{"lon":-0.1171732,"lat":51.511024,"north":51.5117915,"south":51.5102566,"east":-0.1156337,"west":-0.1187126,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"Somerset House is a large building situated on the south side of the Strand in central London, England, overlooking the River Thames, just east of Waterloo Bridge.

It is located at Mayfair in the City of Westminster, London. It was built from 1927 to 1929 on the site of the former London residence of the Dukes of Westminster, whose family name was Grosvenor. \n\nThe hotel has a pedestrian entrance on Park Lane in Mayfair, though the main entrance is actually located on Park Street. It is an outpost of London's largest cluster of luxury hotels, which is centred on Hyde Park Corner.\n\nThe Grosvenor House consists of two buildings standing at 8 floors and 9 floors, and it has 494 rooms, including 74 suites. It underwent a £142,000,000 renovation from 2004 to 2008. It has been managed by the JW Marriott brand since then. \n\nThe Grosvenor House also has a fitness centre, a salon, 4 restaurants, 2 bars, the Park Room (at which afternoon tea is served), 29 breakout meeting rooms, and two ballrooms.

The Square lies within an area bound by Lisle Street, to the north; Charing Cross Road, to the east; Orange Street, to the south; and Whitcomb Street, to the west. The park at the centre of the Square is bound by Cranbourn Street, to the north; Leicester Street, to the east; Irving Street, to the south; and a section of road designated simply as Leicester Square, to the west. It is within the City of Westminster, and about equal distances (about 400 yards or 300 metres) north of Trafalgar Square, east of Piccadilly Circus, west of Covent Garden, and south of Cambridge Circus.\n\nHistory\n \nLeicester Square in 1750, looking north. The large house set behind a forecourt at the northeast corner is Leicester House, then the residence of Frederick, Prince of Wales.The Square is named after Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, who purchased four acres (1.6 hectares) of land in St. Martin's Field in 1630; by 1635, he had built himself a large house, known as Leicester House, at the northern end of it. The area in front of the house was then enclosed, thus depriving the inhabitants of St. Martin's Parish of their right to use the previously common land. The parishioners appealed to King Charles I for assistance, and he appointed three members of the Privy Council to arbitrate. Lord Leicester was ordered to keep part of his land (which thereafter was known as Leicester Field and later as Leicester Square) open for use by the parishioners.\n\nThe area was developed in the 1670s. It was initially a fashionable area, and Leicester House was once even the residence of Frederick, Prince of Wales; but, by the later part of the 18th century, the Square was no longer a smart address and began to serve as a venue for popular entertainments. Leicester House became the home of a museum of natural curisities called the Holophusikon in the 1780s and was demolished about 1791–1792.\n\nIn 1848, Leicester Square was the subject of the famous land-law case of Tulk vs. Moxhay. The plot's previous owner had agreed upon a covenant not to erect buildings after his purchase. However, the law would not allow purchasers who were not 'privy' to the initial contract to be bound by any subsequent promises. The leading judge, Lord Cottenham, decided that future owners of land could be bound by promises to abstain from activity. Otherwise, a buyer could simply sell land to himself again to undermine an initial promise. Hence, the Leicester Square known today was saved from development. By the 19th century, Leicester Square was known as an entertainment venue, and also housed several hotels. It was popular with overseas residents and visitors to London. A large theatre, the Alhambra, built in 1854, dominated the site. The square remains the heart of the West End entertainment district even today.\n\n[edit] Gardens\n \nThe centre of Leicester SquareIn the middle of the Square is a small park, in the centre of which is a 19th century statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins. The four corner gates of the park have one bust each, depicting Sir Isaac Newton, the scientist; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery; and William Hogarth, the painter. The most recent addition is a statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin. On the pavement are inscribed the distances in miles to countries of the former British Empire.\n\n\n[edit] Entertainment\nLeicester Square is the centre of London's cinema land, and one of the signs marking the Square bears the legend \"Theatreland\". It is claimed that the Square contains a cinema with the largest screen and a cinema with the most seats (over 2000). UK film and Royal premieres are regularly hosted at one of the square's four cinemas. Similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the square is surrounded by floor mounted plaques with film stars names and cast handprints.\n[edit] Other attractions\nAffixed to the corner of the Swiss Centre, in the northwest corner of the square, is an elaborate mechanical clock, installed in 1984. The Swiss Centre is marked for demolition so the clock may not be there for a few years.[3] The square regularly hosts a fair each winter and a stage is erected for performances connected to other events such as Chinese New Year.\n\nLeicester Square is a yellow property (£260) on the London monopoly board game."},{"id":10172549,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/10172549/Tottenham-Court-Road-Tube-Station\">Tottenham Court Road Tube Station</a>","title":"Tottenham Court Road Tube Station","tags":[{"id":44629,"title":"invisible"},{"id":44758,"title":"metro station"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tottenham_Court_Road_tube_station","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1297277,"y":51.515523},{"x":-0.130055,"y":51.5153628},{"x":-0.130747,"y":51.5151792},{"x":-0.130865,"y":51.5153561},{"x":-0.1307148,"y":51.5154195},{"x":-0.1308167,"y":51.5156198},{"x":-0.1309562,"y":51.5155865},{"x":-0.1310098,"y":51.5156549},{"x":-0.1312914,"y":51.5161089},{"x":-0.1310661,"y":51.5161423},{"x":-0.1310956,"y":51.5163008},{"x":-0.1305753,"y":51.5163442},{"x":-0.1301461,"y":51.5163609},{"x":-0.1300281,"y":51.5163676}],"location":{"lon":-0.1305096,"lat":51.5157734,"north":51.5163676,"south":51.5151792,"east":-0.1297277,"west":-0.1312914,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Tottenham Court Road currently serves the Northern and Central lines.
