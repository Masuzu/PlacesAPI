This tiny little enclave is tucked away between Piccadilly and Curzon Street, in the exclusive borough of Mayfair. Nowadays, Shepherd Market is better known for its chic boutiques, intimate little restaurants and impressive Victorian pubs. \n\nMayfair itself is named after the infamous fifteen-day fair that took place on the site that is Shepherd Market today, and which was banned in 1708 due to the fair’s revellers’ relentless boisterousness and disorder. A local architect and developer (Edward Shepherd), was commissioned to develop the site after the banning of the fair, and it was completed in the mid 18th century, with paved alleys, a duck pond, and a two-storey market, topped with a theatre. The theatre was opened in the month of May, and attracted a much higher class of visitor than the noisy, unruly fair beforehand.\n\nDuring the 1920's, Shepherd Market was an ultrafashionable address for some of London's most refined inhabitants, who lived there like characters in a play by Noel Coward, the new West End sensation. The writer Michael Arlen rented rooms opposite The Grapes public house, and used Shepherd Market as the setting for his best-selling 1924 novel “The Green Hat”. The book also went on to become a hit Broadway play and a film starring Greta Garbo. \n\nThe village-like area around Shepherd Market still has something of a jaunty reputation. It was round the corner at 9 Curzon Place that Cass Elliot (Mama Cass) of The Mamas and Papas died in July 1974, and, four years later, Keith Moon, drummer with The Who, died of an overdose. Shepherd Market was also where the Tory fraudster and best-selling author, Jeffrey Archer, met the prostitute, Monica Coghlan. And more recently still, it was at the Mirabelle restaurant on Curzon Street where actors Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis spent a cool £17,000 on a meal for two (including £11,000 on a single bottle of burgundy). Emerging from the restaurant, Depp lashed out at the paparazzi and ended up in the local police cells.\n\nNext to Shepherd Market is Half Moon Street, where the fictional Wooster (the perfect upper-class Mayfair resident and his faithful valet Jeeves) of P.G. Wodehouse's novels lived, and where in 1763 the real James Boswell (newly arrived from Edinburgh) took lodgings and wrote his defamatory diary. Curzon Street is home to Crewe House, originally built by Edward Shepherd, but now a company headquarters and one of the few eighteenth-century Mayfair mansions still standing.\n\nhttp://www.shepherdmarket.co.uk/"},{"id":2483421,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/2483421/The-Athenaeum-Club\">The

It is in Travelcard Zone 1.\n\nOn early Tube plans, the station was listed as Cranbourn Street, but the present name was used when the station first opened, on 15 December 1906.\n\nLike other stations on the original sections of the Piccadilly and Northern Lines, the station was originally constructed with lifts providing access to the platforms. The increase in passenger numbers in the 1920s as the Northern line was extended north (to Edgware) and south (to Morden) and the expected further increase from the 1930s extensions of the Piccadilly Line lead to the reconstruction of the station below ground in the early 1930s. New station entrances were constructed to a new sub-surface ticket hall. As with the similar sub-surface ticket hall previously built at Piccadilly Circus this was excavated partially under the roadway. From there banks of escalators were provided down to both sets of platforms. The redundant lifts were removed but the lift shaft remains in use as a ventilation shaft hidden behind a small door on the first landing of the Cranbourn street entrance stairs.\n\nThe escalators down to the Piccadilly Line were the longest on the entire Underground network, being 54 m (177 feet) in length, until the rebuilding and reopening of Angel in 1992, which overtook Leicester Square with its 60 m (197 ft) escalators.\n\nOffices above the red terracotta station building on the east side of Charing Cross Road are occupied by the Northern Line management staff.

The Diorama had a mechanism by which the room the audience sat in was turned from one stage to the other allowing new scenes to be set up. This accounts for the curious shape of the building.\n\nJohn Timbs in his account of the Diorama in his book, The Curiosities of London, written in 1855, said that the Diorama building “has since been converted into a chapel of the Baptist denomination at the expense of Sir Morton Pete”. This reconstruction of the interior probably meant rebuilding the roof resulting in the current large skylights. \n\nIn the early 1990s it was used by a local community 'Diorama Arts centre', but later 18 Park Square East (which formed the entrance to the Diorama when this Nash terrrace was built in the 1820s) became the national headquarters of a charity 'The Prince's Trust'."},{"id":19173381,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/19173381/St-George-s-Church-Holborn\">St. George's Church,

The underground station has 3 ticket halls and is served by six London Underground lines: Piccadilly, Victoria, Northern (via Bank), Circle, Metropolitan and Hammersmith & City. It is the busiest tube station on the London Underground attracting over 72.5 million passengers in 2010.\n\nThe Metropolitan railway built the original sub-surface station in 1863 which was later resited in 1941. The Piccadilly Line was built after the turn of the century, and in 1907 the City & South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) arrived. The Victoria line was built in the 1960s. The proposed Chelsea to Hackney would serve the station also.\n\nIn 1980 a person dropped a smoking cigarette on an upward wooden esculator. This started a fire which slowly travelled upwards. When the the fire reached the Ticket Hall, it suddenly exploded and set parts of the room on fire. 31 people died in the following fire, one of which was a fireman. This led to a ban of all smoking on the London Underground."},{"id":9732056,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/9732056/House-of-Commons-Library\">House of Commons Library</a>","title":"House of Commons Library","tags":[{"id":314,"title":"library"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons_Library","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"439","polygon":[{"x":-0.1239288,"y":51.5000741},{"x":-0.12402,"y":51.49961},{"x":-0.1242399,"y":51.499625},{"x":-0.1241487,"y":51.5000925}],"location":{"lon":-0.1240844,"lat":51.4998512,"north":51.5000925,"south":51.49961,"east":-0.1239288,"west":-0.1242399,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":19},"description":"The House of Commons Library is the library and information resource of the lower house of the British Parliament.
