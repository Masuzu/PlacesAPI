Aldwych occupies one of the most important Edwardian buildings in London.\n\nDesigned and built by Charles Mewes and Arthur Davis, the Anglo-French partnership responsible for the Ritz hotels in London and Paris, it was originally commissioned as the home of the Morning Post newspaper. Completed in 1907, the building is set on a triangular site at the junction of the Aldwych and the Strand and is often described as Mewes and Davis' finest work.\n\nThe building expertly combines Edwardian grandeur with splendid Parisian elegance. Itsdistinctive features include curved corners, a coppered cupola dome and a mansard roof of Westmoreland slate, whilst decorative features such as female head keystones, cornices and low balustrade balconies add to the charming Parisian feel.\n\nhttp://www.onealdwych.com/\n\nIn 1937, the Morning Post moved out and the building became the headquarters of Illustrated Newspapers Limited, a subsidiary of The Inveresk Paper Company Limited and became known as Inveresk House.\n\nIn more recent years it was occupied by various companies including the Prudential Assurance Company and Lloyds Bank before being purchased by private owners and transformed into London's fabulous boutique hotel, One Aldwych.\n\nOne Aldwych London's award-winning contemporary luxury hotel Privately owned Sister hotel to the much talked about Carlisle Bay in Antigua Great location bang in the middle of London in Covent Garden Brilliant contemporary interiors Two fabulous restaurants, Axis at One Aldwych and Indigo The happening Lobby Bar Stunning lap swimming pool with underwater music State-of-the-art gymnasium with dedicated personal trainers 100% pure and natural products Cutting edge technology Sleek contemporary private rooms for formal meetings or beautiful events  Luxurious private screening room Exciting private contemporary art collection (over 400 pieces] Thoughtful unpretentious service and much much more\n\n \n\n\"Nothing is so dull as standardisation and nothing dates so quickly as trendy.  One Aldwych is contemporary, but definitely not trendy, nor is its look purely of the moment.  The interior is interesting and different but comfort and function have not been sacrificed to design.

The Duke of Westminster decided to redevelop the area, and the street was changed, becoming Carlos Place. In 1892 Scorrier, the owner, applied to rebuild the hotel although work did not start until two years later, when the original houses were demolished.\n\nIn 1897, the Coburg Hotel duly opened, named after Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg. In 1917, during World War I, the decision was made to change the name to The Connaught. The name chosen was that of Queen Victoria’s 3rd son, Prince Arthur, the first Duke of Connaught.\n\nIn 1935, Rudolph Richard, a young Swiss hotelier, became general manager of The Connaught and ran the hotel almost as an English private house, with the highest standards of comfort and service. In 1956, The Connaught was acquired by the Savoy Group, owners of Claridge's, The Berkeley and The Savoy in

in 1978, the October Gallery is an art gallery dedicated to the appreciation of art from all cultures around the world. The Gallery exhibits and promotes art of the transvangarde  - or trans-cultural avant-garde - that is to say, the work of artists who, whilst working at the forefront of their own respective cultures, assimilate into their work elements from other cultures as well. During the past twenty-one years, the Gallery has shown the work of such transvangarde  artists as: Gerald Wilde, El Anatsui, William S. Burroughs, Emmanuel Taiwo Jegede, Kenji Yoshida, Aubrey Williams, Ablade Glover and Sokari Douglas Camp amongst many others. As well as exhibitions by individual artists, the Gallery also mounts group exhibitions that concentrate on the art produced in one particular area or culturally continuous region. Amongst these regional exhibitions  have been shows devoted to the art and culture of : Tibet (1991), Trinidad & Tobago (1992), Mongolia (1993), the Horn of Africa (1994) Haiti (1995) South Africa (1996) the Yoruba Diasporas (1997) Oceania (1998) and Peru (1999). Future exhibitions will comprise a series of  shows highlighting the contemporary art coming from shamanistic societies around the world.\n\nNamed after the month in which the Gallery was founded, a season associated with  ripeness and fruition, the October Gallery is a self-supporting charitable trust that, while it receives no core-funding still manages to resist the powerful commercial pressures of the fashionable art world. Support for the project comes from sales of  art, rental of the Gallery's unique facilities, grants from various funding bodies and the active support of a growing number of dedicated artists, musicians, writers and many other such friends from around the world.\n\nIn the twenty-one years since opening its doors to the peripatetic artists, thinkers and scientists of the planet, the Gallery has hosted more than just exhibitions of the visual arts, holding concert performances by the Theatre of All Possibilities and the Bauls of Bengal, performances of Balinese, Indian and Middle Eastern dance, Dervishes from Pakistan, evenings with writers and thinkers that include Lawrence Durrell, Brion Gysin, John Allen and John Lilly and readings by poets such as Christopher Logue, David Gascoyne, Ira Cohen, Johnny Dolphin, Taiwo Jegede, Kathleen Raine and many others."},{"id":28873697,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

It is a Grade I listed building.\n\nIt is the grandest and most familiar survival of the architectural genre of banqueting house. Formerly part of the Palace of Whitehall, it was designed by Inigo Jones in 1619 and completed in 1622 with assistance from John Webb. In 1649 King Charles I of England was executed on a scaffold in front of the building.\n\nInside the building there is a single two-story double-cube room which is decorated with paintings by Sir Peter Paul Rubens that were commissioned by Charles I in 1635 to fill the panelling of the ceiling. The Banqueting House introduced a refined Italianate Renaissance style that was unparalleled in Jacobean England, where Renaissance motives were still filtered through the engravings of Flemish Mannerist designers. The roof is all but flat and the roof line is a balustrade. On the street façade all the elements of two orders of engaged columns, Corinthian over Ionic, above a high rusticated basement, are locked together in a harmonious whole. \n\nThe Banqueting House was planned as part of a grand new Palace of Whitehall, but the tensions that eventually led to the Civil War intervened. In 1685 the Banqueting House became the first building in England to use crown glass in its windows. Later, in the fire that destroyed the old Whitehall Palace the isolated position of the Banqueting Hall preserved it from the flames. \n\nOfficial website:

East India, Devonshire, Sports and Public Schools' Club, usually known as the East India Club, is a gentlemen's club founded in 1849 and situated at 16 St. James's Square in London. Membership of the club is strictly by nomination and election only.\n\nThe East India Club, in the heart of London’s clubland, has a long tradition as a gentlemen’s home from home.\n\nFounded in the middle of the 19th century, its original members were ‘the servants of the East India Company and Commissioned Officers of Her Majesty’s Army and Navy’. The legacy of those early members, home on furlough from far flung lands, continues today. As a private club, only open to members and their guests, the club still provides a refuge and meeting place for busy young men and their more seasoned seniors.\n\nSince those early days, the club has amalgamated with the Devonshire, the Sports and the Public Schools clubs, and also welcomed members of the Eccentric Club. The amalgam has been a happy one, possibly because together, as their titles suggest, the component parts reflect the very best diversity of English tradition. The club retains its international dimension through its reciprocal arrangements with similar clubs throughout the world.\n\n16 St James's Square\nLondon, SW1Y 4LH\nTel: 020 7930 1000\nhttp://www.eastindiaclub.com/"},{"id":18884874,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18884874/Sicilian-Avenue\">Sicilian Avenue</a>","title":"Sicilian Avenue","tags":[{"id":17,"title":"store / shop"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1215658,"y":51.5186459},{"x":-0.1210132,"y":51.5184389},{"x":-0.1209515,"y":51.5183004},{"x":-0.1209596,"y":51.518272},{"x":-0.1217884,"y":51.5185441}],"location":{"lon":-0.12137,"lat":51.5184589,"north":51.5186459,"south":51.518272,"east":-0.1209515,"west":-0.1217884,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Pedestrianised shopping street"},{"id":21907429,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/21907429/South-Wing\">South Wing </a>","title":"South Wing ","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1338664,"y":51.5240499},{"x":-0.1337363,"y":51.5239306},{"x":-0.1331221,"y":51.5241934},{"x":-0.1331958,"y":51.524251},{"x":-0.1331636,"y":51.5242668},{"x":-0.133224,"y":51.5243211},{"x":-0.1334935,"y":51.5242159},{"x":-0.1335177,"y":51.5242293},{"x":-0.1335432,"y":51.5242326},{"x":-0.1335686,"y":51.5242276},{"x":-0.1335874,"y":51.5242218},{"x":-0.1336035,"y":51.5242059},{"x":-0.1336075,"y":51.5241909},{"x":-0.1335981,"y":51.5241692}],"location":{"lon":-0.1334943,"lat":51.5241258,"north":51.5243211,"south":51.5239306,"east":-0.1331221,"west":-0.1338664,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":null}]
