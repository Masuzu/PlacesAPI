site of the Aldgate believed to mean \"old gate\" which is one of the original eight gates into the City of London.\n\nThere was possibly already a gate spanning the road to Colchester, which was once the capital city of England, when the City Wall was built, but the gateway was rebuilt sometime between 1108-47, and again in 1215. It was completely rebuilt again in 1607-9 when Roman coins were found in the foundations, and was finally demolished in 1760 in order to improve traffic access. It was briefly re-erected at Bethnal Green. Its name was often corrupted to Ale-gate or All-gate and meant 'open to all'.\n\nThe gate was to be found at the corner of the streets now known as Aldgate and Duke's Palace; Geoffrey Chaucer lived in rooms over the gate between 1374-85 while he was working as a customs official in the Port of London.\n\nThe Augustinian Priory of Holy Trinity Aldgate was built just inside the gate, and assured the gateway's continued importance. The Priory was founded by Henry I's wife Queen Matilda in 1108. The ground level had already risen seven feet from Roman times.\n\nThe others being:-\nAldersgate.\nBishopsgate\nCripplegate\nLudgate\nMoorgate\nNewgate, and\nTraitors

building is developed by Swanage Ltd who intend it to accommodate 682 square metres of commercial space on the ground floor, basement and first floor, with 50 homes planned above that including 20 of which will be affordable i.e. for keyworkers and certain vulnerable people (see en.wikipedia.org/Affordable_Housing).\n\nThe scheme sits on an empty brownfield site overlooking Southwark Bridge Road and Borough Road just north of the resurgent Elephant and Castle area.\n\nThere is already an 8 floor tall building approved for the site but this one pushes that height level up further, although not exceptionally, and sees the design changed in a move that the architect feels fits in more with the area thanks to the use of industrial brick.
