in Covent Garden.\n\nBow Street is an orange property (£180) on the London monopoly board game. Other orange properties are Marlborough Street and Vine Street.  US equivalent property is St James's Place (Atlantic City).\n\nBow Street is a thoroughfare in Covent Garden, Westminster London. It features as one of the streets on the standard London Monopoly board.\n\nThe area around Bow Street was developed by the Francis Russell, 4th Earl of Bedford in the 1630s. Oliver Cromwell moved to Bow Street in 1645. Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford was born there in 1661. No.4 served as a magistrates court from 1739 and the Bow Street Runners were founded there by Henry Fielding in the 1740s. When the Metropolitan Police Service was established in 1829, a station house was sited at numbers 25 and 27. The former Bow Street Magistrates' Court and police station was completed in 1881 and closed in 2006.

House is a building between Aldwych and The Strand in London at the southern end of Kingsway. The BBC's World Service department occupies four of the five wings, though the BBC staff will soon be moving. The fifth, south-west wing, is used by HM Revenue & Customs. Sections of the building were completed and opened over a period of 13 years:\n\n    * 1923 - Centre Block\n    * 1928 - North-West wing\n    * 1929 - North-East wing\n    * 1930 - South-East wing\n    * 1935 - South-West wing\n\nThis quintessentially British building was commissioned, designed and originally owned by American individuals and companies. Irving T. Bush gained approval for his plans for the building in 1919, which was planned as a major new trade centre and designed by American architect Harvey Wiley Corbett. The construction was undertaken by John Mowlem & Co.\n\nThe building's opening ceremony was performed by Lord Balfour on July 4, 1925 - America's Independence Day. It included the unveiling of two statues at the entrance made by American artist Malvina Hoffman. The statues symbolise Anglo-American friendship and the building bears the inscription ‘Dedicated to the friendship of English-speaking peoples’. Built from Portland stone, Bush House was in 1929 declared the \"most expensive building in the world\", having cost around £2,000,000 ($10,000,000).\n\nAfter a landmine damaged Broadcasting House on December 8, 1940, the BBC's European Service moved into the south-east wing of the building; the rest of the Overseas Service followed in 1958.\n\nThe BBC's lease with Kato Kagaku (the Japanese company that owns the building) expires in 2010. The BBC plans to move World Service to Broadcasting House following its ongoing expansion and renovation programme, known as the W1 Project. There have been renewed rumours that neighbouring London School of Economics may purchase Bush House to expand its campus."},{"id":563356,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/563356/Hungerford-Wing-Shell-Centre\">Hungerford Wing, Shell Centre</a>","title":"Hungerford Wing, Shell Centre","tags":[{"id":109,"title":"building"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_Centre","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1164598,"y":51.5046154},{"x":-0.1165805,"y":51.5044735},{"x":-0.1154633,"y":51.5040882},{"x":-0.1155036,"y":51.5040499},{"x":-0.1151093,"y":51.5041263},{"x":-0.1152488,"y":51.5041818},{"x":-0.1151764,"y":51.5042686},{"x":-0.1153561,"y":51.5043337},{"x":-0.1154285,"y":51.5042485}],"location":{"lon":-0.1158449,"lat":51.5043326,"north":51.5046154,"south":51.5040499,"east":-0.1151093,"west":-0.1165805,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Part of Shell Centre."},{"id":10802768,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/10802768/NIOC-House\">NIOC House</a>","title":"NIOC House","tags":[{"id":109,"title":"building"},{"id":323,"title":"business centre/ building"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1299329,"y":51.4994789},{"x":-0.1301153,"y":51.4994229},{"x":-0.130173,"y":51.4994538},{"x":-0.1302628,"y":51.4994213},{"x":-0.1302373,"y":51.4993704},{"x":-0.1309267,"y":51.4991182},{"x":-0.1310796,"y":51.4992777},{"x":-0.1308006,"y":51.4993837},{"x":-0.130747,"y":51.4993261},{"x":-0.1304492,"y":51.4994355},{"x":-0.130464,"y":51.4994952},{"x":-0.1307698,"y":51.4995018},{"x":-0.1307738,"y":51.4994538},{"x":-0.1308328,"y":51.4994526},{"x":-0.1308247,"y":51.4996283},{"x":-0.1303285,"y":51.49961},{"x":-0.1303151,"y":51.4995707},{"x":-0.1302132,"y":51.499569},{"x":-0.1301877,"y":51.4996208},{"x":-0.1299812,"y":51.4996041}],"location":{"lon":-0.1305063,"lat":51.4993732,"north":51.4996283,"south":51.4991182,"east":-0.1299329,"west":-0.1310796,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Business center."},{"id":27396505,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/27396505/7-North-Audley-Street\">7 North Audley Street</a>","title":"7 North Audley Street","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1528752,"y":51.5120883},{"x":-0.1526499,"y":51.5121303},{"x":-0.1526767,"y":51.512197},{"x":-0.1529128,"y":51.5121553},{"x":-0.152953,"y":51.5122571},{"x":-0.1527317,"y":51.5122957},{"x":-0.1527706,"y":51.5123773},{"x":-0.15289,"y":51.5123571},{"x":-0.1528967,"y":51.5123717},{"x":-0.1530113,"y":51.5123521},{"x":-0.153075,"y":51.5124948},{"x":-0.1525185,"y":51.5125893},{"x":-0.1524488,"y":51.5124364},{"x":-0.1525587,"y":51.5124157},{"x":-0.1524407,"y":51.512167},{"x":-0.1524172,"y":51.5121718},{"x":-0.1524032,"y":51.512143},{"x":-0.1523522,"y":51.5121522},{"x":-0.1523026,"y":51.512047},{"x":-0.1528109,"y":51.511954}],"location":{"lon":-0.1526888,"lat":51.5122716,"north":51.5125893,"south":51.511954,"east":-0.1523026,"west":-0.153075,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Former headquarters of U.S. Naval Forces, Europe.

Famed Swiss hotelier César Ritz opened the hotel on May 24, 1906. The building is neoclassical in the Louis XVI manner, built during the Belle Époque to resemble a stylish Parisian block of flats, over arcades that consciously evoked the Rue de Rivoli. Its architects were Charles Mewès, who had previously designed Ritz's Hôtel Ritz Paris, and Arthur Davis, with engineering collaboration by the Swedish engineer Sven Bylander. It was the first substantial steel-frame structure in London.\n\nAddress:\n150 Piccadilly\nLondon, W1J 9BR\nTel: (0) 20 7493 8181\nFax: (0) 20 7493 2687\nE-mail
