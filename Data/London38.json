Fields was a large, low red-brick complex built in the late 1970s as a computer centre, interbank cheque clearing centre and IT development centre for National Westminster Bank.

In the mid 1980s an extension was built on the west of the site, replacing a small parade of shops/offices at the southeast corner of the junction of Alie Street and Leman Street. In the early 1990s the mainframe computers were removed. In 2000 NatWest was taken over by Royal Bank of Scotland. The \"Goodmans Campus\" includes the Eastgate House and 75 Leman Street buildings on Leman Street. In 2006, development started on part of the site to create Berkeley Homes' City Quarter.

Paul's Cathedral is the diocesan seat of the Bishop of London, located on Ludgate Hill, the highest point in the City. The present building dates from the 17th century and was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. It is thought to be London's fifth church named for the saint since 604 A.D., all on this same site. The cathedral is one of London's most famous and recognisable sights. At 365 feet high, it was the tallest building in London from 1710 to 1962, and its dome is also among the highest in the world, St Peter's Basilica in Rome being higher. The Monument to the 1666 Great Fire of London, also designed by Wren and the tallest doric column in the world, would fit inside the cathedral's interior.\nhttp://www.stpauls.co.uk/"},{"id":7011,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/7011/Blackfriars-Bridge\">Blackfriars Bridge</a>","title":"Blackfriars Bridge","tags":[{"id":44607,"title":"bridge"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackfriars_Bridge","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1045471,"y":51.5109076},{"x":-0.1046504,"y":51.5108133},{"x":-0.1046464,"y":51.5107015},{"x":-0.1046464,"y":51.5106889},{"x":-0.1046343,"y":51.5106797},{"x":-0.1045914,"y":51.5106781},{"x":-0.1046088,"y":51.5101789},{"x":-0.1046504,"y":51.5101773},{"x":-0.1046652,"y":51.5101656},{"x":-0.1046678,"y":51.5101514},{"x":-0.1046571,"y":51.5101406},{"x":-0.1046102,"y":51.5101406},{"x":-0.104633,"y":51.5096097},{"x":-0.1046719,"y":51.5096114},{"x":-0.1046933,"y":51.5095963},{"x":-0.104692,"y":51.509578},{"x":-0.1046745,"y":51.5095696},{"x":-0.1046343,"y":51.5095696},{"x":-0.1046531,"y":51.5090755},{"x":-0.1046893,"y":51.5090763},{"x":-0.1047121,"y":51.5090655},{"x":-0.1047108,"y":51.509053},{"x":-0.1046933,"y":51.5090413},{"x":-0.1046571,"y":51.5090413},{"x":-0.1046719,"y":51.5086081},{"x":-0.1046893,"y":51.5086081},{"x":-0.104692,"y":51.5085956},{"x":-0.1047215,"y":51.5085797},{"x":-0.1047215,"y":51.5085329},{"x":-0.1046893,"y":51.5085163},{"x":-0.1042011,"y":51.5085104},{"x":-0.1041864,"y":51.5085112},{"x":-0.1041542,"y":51.5085263},{"x":-0.1041502,"y":51.5085697},{"x":-0.1041676,"y":51.508588},{"x":-0.104169,"y":51.5086089},{"x":-0.1041931,"y":51.5086089},{"x":-0.104173,"y":51.5090354},{"x":-0.1041368,"y":51.5090371},{"x":-0.1041166,"y":51.5090463},{"x":-0.1041166,"y":51.5090605},{"x":-0.1041354,"y":51.5090738},{"x":-0.1041716,"y":51.509073},{"x":-0.1041515,"y":51.5095621},{"x":-0.104114,"y":51.5095646},{"x":-0.1040912,"y":51.5095771},{"x":-0.1040898,"y":51.5095922},{"x":-0.104114,"y":51.5096014},{"x":-0.1041515,"y":51.5096022},{"x":-0.1041301,"y":51.510133},{"x":-0.1040871,"y":51.510133},{"x":-0.1040697,"y":51.5101414},{"x":-0.1040711,"y":51.5101614},{"x":-0.1040925,"y":51.5101748},{"x":-0.1041287,"y":51.5101723},{"x":-0.1041126,"y":51.5106722},{"x":-0.1040724,"y":51.5106722},{"x":-0.1040536,"y":51.5106906},{"x":-0.1040751,"y":51.5107073},{"x":-0.1041153,"y":51.510709},{"x":-0.1041086,"y":51.5108024},{"x":-0.104118,"y":51.5108726},{"x":-0.1041113,"y":51.5111455},{"x":-0.104177,"y":51.5111405},{"x":-0.1041837,"y":51.5109894},{"x":-0.1043044,"y":51.510971}],"location":{"lon":-0.1043876,"lat":51.5098279,"north":51.5111455,"south":51.5085104,"east":-0.1040536,"west":-0.1047215,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Designed by Joseph Cubitt, with five wrought iron arches, the bridge was opened in 1869.

is the site of several important prisons, over 500 years, from ca. 1300 - 1849. Most famously, this is the final location of the Marshalsea Prison, of Dickensian fame. First noted in the early 14th century, and originally located just north of here, the Marshalsea Prison opened here in 1811, housing Southwark's debtors, trespassers, smugglers, and court martialed Admiralty members, often with their families. Charles Dickens's father spent time here as a debtor, which had a major impact on Dickens's future writing career. He wrote \"Little Dorrit\" based on his own experiences as a child, with her father also a Marshalsea debtor prisoner.\n\nDickens wrote about this alley, then called Angel Court, in Little Dorrit:\n\"Whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find his feet on the very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea Goal; will see its narrow yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; will stand among the crowded ghosts of many miserable years.\"\n\nThe prison was closed in 1842, and demolished in 1849; all that remains today is the long brick wall along its southern boundary, with the original arched entry gates, on the south side of the alleyway.\n\nThis site was also where the King's Bench Prison was located for over 500 years, from ca. 1300 - 1758. The White Lion jail (marked as \"Borough Goal\" on cartographer Richard Horwood's 1799 detailed map), noted for its barbarity in the 17-18th centuries, was also located here."},{"id":28859010,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/28859010/Old-Justice\">Old Justice</a>","title":"Old

English Heritage took little interest in the goods station stating at the earlier Transport & Works Inquiry that \"there was 'nothing of special architectural or historic interest' other than the gates and screen wall that were already listed (1996) at the time\". There was an immediate public outcry that the demolition of the goods station would lead to the loss of the Braithwaite Viaduct which is one of the oldest railway structures in the world and the second oldest in London. It was designed by John Braithwaite (1797-1870), chief engineer of the Eastern Counties Railway, who with his partner Captain Jon Ericsson, raced George Stevenson's 'Rocket' for the Rainhill trials in 1829.\n\nThe viaduct was originally 2km in length but now only 260 metres of the original construction survives encapsulated within the structure of the Bishopsgate Goods Station."},{"id":14753759,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

The area was heavily populated by the late 17th century and deteriorated into the \"Venice of Drains\"described by Charles Dickens.  Part of his novel, Oliver Twist was set here.
