The 26-storey building has a height of 104 m (341 ft) and a floor area of 30,000 sq m (322,900 sq ft). The mechanical floors are on levels LG, 14, and 27. It was originally designed by Richard Seifert and constructed from 1971 to 1976. The building was occupied by HSBC until they moved to Canary Wharf.\n\n99 Bishopsgate was extensively damaged by an IRA bomb in April 1993. It was later refurbished from 1993 to 1995. The refurbishment resulted in substantially improved cladding and a facade overrun which slightly increased its overall height. 99 Bishopsgate is now a multi-let office tower. CBRE has produced an Energy Performance Certificate for 99 Bishopsgate which has resulted in a C rating for the building."},{"id":14337,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/14337/Hoxton-Square\">Hoxton Square</a>","title":"Hoxton Square","tags":[{"id":129,"title":"square"},{"id":194,"title":"park"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoxton_Square","is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.0815311,"y":51.5280132},{"x":-0.0815526,"y":51.5274325},{"x":-0.0815365,"y":51.5274025},{"x":-0.0809357,"y":51.5273841},{"x":-0.0809518,"y":51.5280165},{"x":-0.0809973,"y":51.5280466},{"x":-0.0815123,"y":51.5280432}],"location":{"lon":-0.0812442,"lat":51.5277153,"north":51.5280466,"south":51.5273841,"east":-0.0809357,"west":-0.0815526,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231451,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Hoxton square (and associated area) is part of the borough of Hackney, home to many art galleries and bars;
