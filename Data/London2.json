The line was operated by steam locomotives, creating the necessity to leave periodical gaps open to the air.\n\nFrom 1 August 1872, the \"Middle Circle\" service also began operation through Victoria, from Moorgate along the MR on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith & City Railway (H&CR) to Latimer Road and then, via a now-demolished link, to the West London Line to Addison Road and the MDR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&CR and the MDR. On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was withdrawn between Earl's Court and Mansion House. On 31 December 1908 the Outer Circle service was also withdrawn.\n\nThe original MDR station was rebuilt at the beginning of the 20th century, initially as a single-storey structure. An office building was built above it later. The line was electrified in 1902/3.In 1949, the Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle Line (Yellow).\n\nVictoria Line station\nThe Victoria line station opened on 7 March 1969, when the third phase of the line began operating, south of Warren Street. Victoria was the terminus while the final phase was under construction to Brixton, opened on 23 July 1971.\n\nProposed future works.\nVictoria is a proposed stop on Crossrail 2, formerly the Chelsea-Hackney line. The route was safeguarded in 1991 and 2007 and any rebuilding of the station will have space for Crossrail 2 platforms.It has been proposed that the Docklands Light Railway become one of two projects for the future of Victoria station, the other being Crossrail 2.\n\nCurrent redevelopment works.\nIn order to provide a lasting solution to the current overc-rowding problem preparatory building work has begun on major upgrade of the station. This will include a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street which will be accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place that will lead to both the Victoria Line and the Circle and District Line platforms. This upgrade is due by 2018.The work will also enlarge the existing Victoria Line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of escalators there. This aspect of the scheme has been criticised as access to platforms from the new escalators will be very long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.\n\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/corporate/vsu-current-proposals-aug-08.pdf\nhttp://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/projectsandschemes/2359.aspx"},{"id":18465852,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/18465852/Grosvenor-Estate-LCC-Housing\">Grosvenor Estate LCC Housing</a>","title":"Grosvenor Estate LCC Housing","tags":[{"id":45513,"title":"public housing estate"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1316535,"y":51.4943801},{"x":-0.1316214,"y":51.4939492},{"x":-0.1313961,"y":51.4939576},{"x":-0.1314041,"y":51.493991},{"x":-0.1314873,"y":51.4939943},{"x":-0.1315007,"y":51.4943166},{"x":-0.1314095,"y":51.4943183},{"x":-0.1314175,"y":51.4942866},{"x":-0.1313692,"y":51.4942866},{"x":-0.1313612,"y":51.4943183},{"x":-0.1312834,"y":51.4943133},{"x":-0.1312727,"y":51.4939559},{"x":-0.1311359,"y":51.4939609},{"x":-0.1311332,"y":51.4943784},{"x":-0.1308918,"y":51.4943834},{"x":-0.1308757,"y":51.4939626},{"x":-0.1309589,"y":51.4939626},{"x":-0.1309669,"y":51.494016},{"x":-0.1310501,"y":51.494016},{"x":-0.1310527,"y":51.4939609},{"x":-0.130873,"y":51.4939559},{"x":-0.130873,"y":51.4938457},{"x":-0.1310474,"y":51.4938424},{"x":-0.1310501,"y":51.4937889},{"x":-0.1309535,"y":51.4937906},{"x":-0.1309615,"y":51.4938424},{"x":-0.1308784,"y":51.4938407},{"x":-0.1308274,"y":51.4927836},{"x":-0.1306906,"y":51.4927853},{"x":-0.130696,"y":51.4928487},{"x":-0.130468,"y":51.4928537},{"x":-0.1304653,"y":51.4927886},{"x":-0.1303393,"y":51.4927853},{"x":-0.1303339,"y":51.4929289},{"x":-0.1308301,"y":51.4929239},{"x":-0.1308355,"y":51.4930491},{"x":-0.1307014,"y":51.4930508},{"x":-0.1307201,"y":51.4937772},{"x":-0.1306424,"y":51.4937839},{"x":-0.1306397,"y":51.4937589},{"x":-0.130586,"y":51.4937605},{"x":-0.1305833,"y":51.4937839},{"x":-0.1305109,"y":51.4937822},{"x":-0.1305002,"y":51.4934199},{"x":-0.1303527,"y":51.4934265},{"x":-0.1303741,"y":51.4938424},{"x":-0.130865,"y":51.493844},{"x":-0.130873,"y":51.4939609},{"x":-0.1307255,"y":51.4939659},{"x":-0.1307362,"y":51.49432},{"x":-0.1306584,"y":51.4943283},{"x":-0.1306584,"y":51.4942932},{"x":-0.1306048,"y":51.4942932},{"x":-0.1306021,"y":51.4943283},{"x":-0.130527,"y":51.4943266},{"x":-0.1305217,"y":51.4939643},{"x":-0.1303795,"y":51.4939693},{"x":-0.1303849,"y":51.4943901},{"x":-0.1301274,"y":51.4943934},{"x":-0.1301193,"y":51.4939726},{"x":-0.1299691,"y":51.4939743},{"x":-0.1299798,"y":51.4943316},{"x":-0.1299047,"y":51.49433},{"x":-0.1299047,"y":51.4943116},{"x":-0.1298565,"y":51.4943133},{"x":-0.1298457,"y":51.494335},{"x":-0.1297733,"y":51.494335},{"x":-0.1297653,"y":51.4939776},{"x":-0.1296258,"y":51.4939759},{"x":-0.1296178,"y":51.4938557},{"x":-0.1301193,"y":51.4938507},{"x":-0.1301059,"y":51.4934265},{"x":-0.1299611,"y":51.4934249},{"x":-0.1299691,"y":51.4937906},{"x":-0.1298726,"y":51.4937956},{"x":-0.1298699,"y":51.4937689},{"x":-0.129827,"y":51.4937689},{"x":-0.129827,"y":51.4937956},{"x":-0.1297599,"y":51.4937906},{"x":-0.1297385,"y":51.4930608},{"x":-0.1296017,"y":51.4930625},{"x":-0.1296017,"y":51.4929539},{"x":-0.1300898,"y":51.4929406},{"x":-0.1300818,"y":51.4928036},{"x":-0.1299316,"y":51.4928103},{"x":-0.1299369,"y":51.4928721},{"x":-0.1297304,"y":51.4928754},{"x":-0.129725,"y":51.4928053},{"x":-0.1295856,"y":51.492807},{"x":-0.1296312,"y":51.4944034}],"location":{"lon":-0.1306196,"lat":51.4935935,"north":51.4944034,"south":51.4927836,"east":-0.1295856,"west":-0.1316535,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":16},"description":"Tenement courtyard block of flats. 1928-30; consultant Sir Edwin Lutyens; part of the Westminster Housing Scheme for the Grosvenor Estate. \n\nGrey brick and white rendered chequerboard external elevations with grey brick and rendered access galleries to courtyard elevations, spare stone dressings, concealed roofs.

Painted red because it is at the Lords end of the Houses of Parliament - see also Westminster Bridge. \n\nLambeth bridge-photos on google maps:\nhttp://wiki.worldflicks.org/lambeth_bridge.html ."},{"id":21809774,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/21809774/30-Millbank\">30 Millbank </a>","title":"30 Millbank ","tags":[{"id":182,"title":"office building"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1258908,"y":51.4928988},{"x":-0.125868,"y":51.4929322},{"x":-0.1258573,"y":51.4929631},{"x":-0.1258586,"y":51.4930191},{"x":-0.1253678,"y":51.4930291},{"x":-0.1253732,"y":51.4928604},{"x":-0.1253852,"y":51.4927377},{"x":-0.1254322,"y":51.4925991},{"x":-0.1255609,"y":51.4922985},{"x":-0.1256749,"y":51.4921607},{"x":-0.1256749,"y":51.4920221},{"x":-0.1257902,"y":51.4917565},{"x":-0.1260746,"y":51.4917499},{"x":-0.1261765,"y":51.4920054},{"x":-0.126273,"y":51.4920438},{"x":-0.1260719,"y":51.4922575},{"x":-0.1260772,"y":51.4924713},{"x":-0.1258519,"y":51.492468},{"x":-0.1258519,"y":51.4924212},{"x":-0.1256964,"y":51.4923895},{"x":-0.125632,"y":51.4924596},{"x":-0.1255596,"y":51.4925915},{"x":-0.1255167,"y":51.4927018},{"x":-0.1254952,"y":51.4927903},{"x":-0.1254952,"y":51.4928855},{"x":-0.1256588,"y":51.4928838},{"x":-0.1257996,"y":51.4927285},{"x":-0.1258264,"y":51.4926968},{"x":-0.1258399,"y":51.4926567},{"x":-0.1258506,"y":51.4926249},{"x":-0.1258479,"y":51.4924847},{"x":-0.1260678,"y":51.492488},{"x":-0.1260705,"y":51.4925431},{"x":-0.1260893,"y":51.4925799},{"x":-0.1261215,"y":51.4926183},{"x":-0.1261698,"y":51.492645},{"x":-0.1262341,"y":51.4926634},{"x":-0.1265694,"y":51.4927168},{"x":-0.1265506,"y":51.4927535},{"x":-0.1265855,"y":51.4927594},{"x":-0.1265909,"y":51.4927519},{"x":-0.1266003,"y":51.4927469},{"x":-0.1266137,"y":51.4927435},{"x":-0.1266284,"y":51.4927444},{"x":-0.1266432,"y":51.4927502},{"x":-0.1266472,"y":51.4927619},{"x":-0.1266177,"y":51.4928086},{"x":-0.1265346,"y":51.4927953},{"x":-0.1265131,"y":51.4928521},{"x":-0.1262073,"y":51.4928003},{"x":-0.1261403,"y":51.4927919},{"x":-0.1260786,"y":51.4927953},{"x":-0.1260222,"y":51.4928053},{"x":-0.1259659,"y":51.4928253},{"x":-0.125923,"y":51.4928587}],"location":{"lon":-0.1260075,"lat":51.4923895,"north":51.4930291,"south":51.4917499,"east":-0.1253678,"west":-0.1266472,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"The Millbank complex"},{"id":31315000,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/31315000/Vauxhall-Island-Towers-future-skyscrapers\">Vauxhall Island Towers (future skyscrapers)</a>","title":"Vauxhall Island Towers (future skyscrapers)","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1247549,"y":51.4853315},{"x":-0.125935,"y":51.4846066},{"x":-0.1258921,"y":51.4844596},{"x":-0.1251197,"y":51.4843895},{"x":-0.1249534,"y":51.4845565},{"x":-0.1245725,"y":51.4852079},{"x":-0.1246208,"y":51.4853348}],"location":{"lon":-0.1252538,"lat":51.4848621,"north":51.4853348,"south":51.4843895,"east":-0.1245725,"west":-0.125935,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Approved project for two towers, tallest 140m"},{"id":203277,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/203277/Peter-Jones\">Peter Jones</a>","title":"Peter Jones","tags":[{"id":44699,"title":"department store"}],"wikipedia":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jones_(department_store)","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1597309,"y":51.4922642},{"x":-0.1593956,"y":51.4918284},{"x":-0.1582316,"y":51.492306},{"x":-0.1583228,"y":51.4925782},{"x":-0.159106,"y":51.4924863},{"x":-0.1592267,"y":51.4924579},{"x":-0.1595619,"y":51.492331},{"x":-0.1595512,"y":51.4923043}],"location":{"lon":-0.1589813,"lat":51.4922033,"north":51.4925782,"south":51.4918284,"east":-0.1582316,"west":-0.1597309,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"Peter Jones is one of the largest and best known department stores in central London, United Kingdom. It is a store of the John Lewis Partnership and located in Sloane Square in the fashionable Chelsea district, close to the elite districts of Belgravia and Knightsbridge. Peter Jones was founded as an independent store but was taken over in the 1920s to form part of the John Lewis Partnership.\n\nThe shop is named after Peter Rees Jones (1843–1905), the son of a Monmouthshire hat manufacturer. After serving an apprenticeship with a draper in Carmarthen he moved to London and set up in business. He started out in a small shop in Hackney, but soon moved to central London before moving on to 4–6 Kings Road, which is part of the site of the present store, in 1877. The neighbourhood was fashionable and the business flourished, soon expanding to cover most of the block. By the time Jones died, however, it had fallen on hard times, and a year later it was purchased by John Lewis of the eponymous Oxford Street store, who handed it over to his son John Spedan Lewis in 1914. Soon after it became part of the John Lewis profit sharing partnership. The present building, which occupies the whole of an island site on the west side of Sloane Square, was built between 1932 and 1936 to designs by the firm of Slater, Crabtree and Moberly. The building featured the first glass curtain walling in Britain and is now a Grade II* listed building.\n\nIt is seen as rather exclusive (although its stock and decor are no different from other John Lewis stores) and a cut above the partnership's other central London department store, the original and flagship John Lewis store in Oxford Street, and this aura of exclusiveness is the main reason the owners (which, as it is in the John Lewis Partnership, means its staff) have kept its separate identity. The store was given a major overhaul in the early years of the 21st century, and some departments relocated to nearby premises for a time."},{"id":30849114,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/30849114/123-Victoria-Street\">123 Victoria Street</a>","title":"123
