Bar evokes a convivial atmosphere with a roaring fire, cosy velvet armchairs and sofa seating, bookcases filled with over 1,000 antique books hand-picked by a Portobello antique dealer and low-key lighting. The space is being lovingly evolved into a living canvas by artist Gerald Scarfe whose characterful illustrations will adorn the marble walls and discreet, intimate corners, meticulously designed by the renowned Martin Brudnizki.\n\nWith its own entrance off High Holborn, Scarfes Bar is open daily for residents and non-residents from midday to 1:00 a.m. Reservations can be made for lunch which includes spicy Indian curries and European-style casseroles and is served from noon to 3:30 p.m. whilst a range of bar snacks and light dishes such as Fried Lobster Momo’s, Veal and Mushroom Meatballs and Bengali Vegetable Chops are served throughout the evening alongside an intriguing selection of cocktails, gins and whiskies.\n\nThe bartenders are true connoisseurs of their craft from advising on beers and matching wines to preparing specially-curated cocktails, some of which are poured from a stunning silver urn that takes centre stage on the long wooden bar. With over 200 single malts and a rare specialisation in sloe gin, including the hotel’s own label of the supremely British spirit, Scarfes Bar is a must-visit in the heart of Holborn."},{"id":30209330,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/30209330/Holborn-Dining-Room\">Holborn Dining Room</a>","title":"Holborn Dining Room","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":false,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"1390553","polygon":[{"x":-0.1178134,"y":51.5174216},{"x":-0.1178134,"y":51.5174216},{"x":-0.1178134,"y":51.5174216},{"x":-0.1178134,"y":51.5174216}],"location":{"lon":-0.1178134,"lat":51.5174216,"north":51.5174216,"south":51.5174216,"east":-0.1178134,"west":-0.1178134,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":24},"description":"Previously the East Banking Hall of Pearl Assurance, Holborn Dining Room forms part of the newly opened Rosewood London.
