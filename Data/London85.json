Today the building is a mixture of offices, a hotel and a restaurant (called Le Scala, in reference to its original name)."},{"id":28875141,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/28875141/Troutbeck\">Troutbeck</a>","title":"Troutbeck","tags":null,"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1440195,"y":51.5270489},{"x":-0.143866,"y":51.5270447},{"x":-0.143881,"y":51.5284324},{"x":-0.1440286,"y":51.5284359}],"location":{"lon":-0.1439473,"lat":51.5277403,"north":51.5284359,"south":51.5270447,"east":-0.143866,"west":-0.1440286,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":0,"gadm":null,"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":20},"description":null},{"id":14541366,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/14541366/Royal-Parks-HQ-and-Information-Centre\">Royal Parks HQ and Information Centre</a>","title":"Royal Parks HQ and Information Centre","tags":[{"id":45611,"title":"information centre"}],"wikipedia":null,"is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.1658651,"y":51.5082959},{"x":-0.16579,"y":51.5079019},{"x":-0.1652643,"y":51.5079336},{"x":-0.1653528,"y":51.5083276}],"location":{"lon":-0.1655647,"lat":51.5081147,"north":51.5083276,"south":51.5079019,"east":-0.1652643,"west":-0.1658651,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231307,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":18},"description":"Maps and leaflets about all Royal Parks, not just Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, available here."},{"id":20711006,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\" href=\"http://wikimapia.org/20711006/Premier-Inn-London-Euston\">Premier Inn London Euston</a>","title":"Premier Inn London Euston","tags":[{"id":50,"title":"hotel"}],"wikipedia":"","is_building":true,"is_region":false,"is_deleted":false,"parent_id":"0","polygon":[{"x":-0.129375,"y":51.5277587},{"x":-0.1291792,"y":51.5278322},{"x":-0.1291658,"y":51.5278196},{"x":-0.1284094,"y":51.5281334},{"x":-0.1282994,"y":51.5280274},{"x":-0.1283424,"y":51.5280099},{"x":-0.1283209,"y":51.5279915},{"x":-0.1290531,"y":51.5277062},{"x":-0.1289579,"y":51.5276186},{"x":-0.1288654,"y":51.5276553},{"x":-0.1288453,"y":51.5276352},{"x":-0.1289378,"y":51.5275969},{"x":-0.1288868,"y":51.5275476},{"x":-0.1290706,"y":51.5274717}],"location":{"lon":-0.1288372,"lat":51.5278025,"north":51.5281334,"south":51.5274717,"east":-0.1282994,"west":-0.129375,"country":"United Kingdom","state":"England","place":"London","country_adm_id":231453,"gadm":[{"id":"1000","country":"0","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"World","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"World"},{"id":"232","country":"232","level":"0","is_last_level":"0","name":"United Kingdom","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"United Kingdom"},{"id":"231284","country":"232","level":"1","is_last_level":"0","name":"England","iso":null,"type":null,"translation":"England"}],"city_id":"5601707","city":"London","zoom":17},"description":"A converted former Camden Council office block.

Tower is a skyscraper located in the London Borough or Camden. It is a good example of an international-style skyscraper with glass curtain walls. It is situated on the intersection of Tottenham Court Road/Hampstead Road. It stands across from Warren street Underground Station. The building is 124 metres (407 ft) and has 36 floors. It was designed by Sidney Kaye and was built in 1970.\n\nAround Londoners, the Euston Tower was most famous for being the home of Capital radio from 1973 until 1997, at which point they moved to Leicester Square. It was common for Capital to announce itself as broadcasting \"from the top of the Euston Tower\", but in fact Capital's offices and studios were all based on the ground- and first-floor sections rather than in the actual skyscraper section. ITV station Thames Television occupied premises adjacent to the tower from 1970 to 1993 although these have been subsequently redeveloped.\n\nOriginally, the base of the tower was a raised platform with a series of walkways in the first floor connecting the tower with the other buildings on the Euston Centre. Recent renovation work by Arup has seen cafes and shops open in the base. An HM Revenue and Customs office is located here. The upper 10 floors are the London home of WS Atkins PLC. The development around Euston Tower is now branded Regent's Place and is managed by British Land."},{"id":35978,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

Montcalm Hotel was a development spanning the buildings at 34-40 Great Cumberland Place, London within Westminster's Portman Square conservation area.\n\nIn 1532 Sir William Portman took on a lease of around 270 acres that included this area of which in 1554 the freehold was conveyed in perpetuity to Sir William and his heirs.\n\nThe grid of streets which now make up the Portman Estate began to be laid out from 1757 when Marylebone Road was laid to provide a route to the City bypassing the West End.  In 1763 the peace negotiated between France and England made London's landowners more confident about leasing their lands for development, and by 1764 the laying out of Portman Square and some neighbouring streets had begun.  By 1820 the development of the Estate was complete.\n\nThe original houses at 34-40 Great Cumberland Place were erected speculatively by developers who leased plots from the Portman family from 1789.  Each house probably had four storeys (including an attic storey) over a basement, and was three bays wide. All the houses came with stabling in Quebec Mews, directly behind, which was accessed from New Quebec Street.\n\nExterior alterations were made to the houses during the nineteenth century and this included the conversion to cottages of Quebec Mews.  In January 1941 a bomb landed close to the Great Cumberland Place crescent and damaged all of its buildings.  Numbers 34-38 suffered minor blast damage and number 40 was recorded as seriously damaged, but repairable.  A bunker was built during the war immediately outside the front of these buildings on the crescent.\n\nFollowing the war numbers 34-40 continued as individual dwellings until sometime before 1964, when 34-38 were converted into one building called East Africa House.  Number 40 was still a separate house or office.\n\nIn the early 1970's Piccadilly Estate Hotels Ltd put forward a plan to build a 112 bedroom hotel on the site of 34-40 Great Cumberland Place.  Westminster Council insisted that the crescent-shaped Georgian facade was retained. The new hotel opened in 1973 and was named The Montcalm, after the Marquis de Montcalm, who commanded the French forces defeated by the English in the struggle for possession of Canada in the mid-eighteenth century.  The link being the date of this battle and of the original building, also the Canadian province Quebec, which had leant its name to the original mews to the rear of the building.\n\nThe Hotel is within the London Borough of Westminster's Portman Square conservation area, which was designated in 1967 and extended in 1979 and 1990. This area within the parish of St. Marylebone was once covered with trees and marshland as part of the ancient forest of Middlesex."},{"id":19558904,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a

London Eye is a Ferris wheel situated at the banks of the River Thames in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is 135 m (443 ft) tall and is supported by an A-frame on its eastern side. It has 32 ovoidal capsules, each with the capacity to hold 25 people. The wheel rotates at 26 cm (10 in) per second, so that one revolution takes about 30 minutes. The London Eye was designed by a consortium of seven architects and built from 1998 to 1999 at a cost of £70,000,000. The wheel has become a major landmark and tourist attraction for London.\n\nRiverside Bldg, County Hall\nWestminster Bridge Rd, London SE1 7PB, United Kingdom\n0870 990

Odeon Leicester Square is a cinema which occupies the centre of the eastern side of Leicester Square, London, dominating the Square with its huge black polished granite facade and high tower displaying its name. Blue neon outlines the exterior of the building at night, making a dramatic presence on the West End. It was built in 1937 on the site of the Alhambra Theatre, a large music hall dating from the 1850s. It is the venue for most of the (royal) premieres in London.\n\nIt is the largest cinema in Great Britain and one of the few with its circle and stalls remaining intact. The cinema is fully equipped to show films in 35mm and 70mm on a large screen, as well as extensive stage facilities for the occasional live show. The cinema still has an operating Compton organ and safety curtain detailed in 1930s art-deco motifs. Two sets of tabs (curtains) are also installed. It houses all major digital sound systems: SDDS, Dolby Digital and DTS. It had Great Britain's first wide-screen installed in 1953, and more recently, was the first to have a digital projector installed in 1999.\n\nSeating is approximately 1700 — reduced from nearly 2000 to make way for greater leg-room — with a large circle bar and even 'royal retiring room' for visiting monarchs! Seating is divided between the Royal Circle, Rear Circle and Stalls.\n\nUntil 1967, the interior was a magnificent art-deco auditorium, with a ribbed ceiling, concealing stripped lighting. Two bas relief sculpture of naked nymphs were positioned on the side walls, as if leaping towards the screen. All the seats were covered in a faux-leopard skin material. A rather misguided modernisation in 1967 destroyed much of this grandeur, although since the 1980s, restoration programmes have restored much of this detail, including the figures and seating pattern."},{"id":3639076,"language_id":0,"language_iso":"en","urlhtml":"<a class=\"wikimapia-link\"

Keynes Purchase in association with Durward Brown, the original building was completed in 1923 to house the headquarters of Cox & Company and later became Cox's & King's following the acquisition of Henry S. King & Co. It was subsequently taken over by Lloyd's Bank who occupied the building in the years following.\n\nFounder Richard Cox was appointed agent for the First Regiment of Foot Guards, later called the Grenadier Guards, in 1758. In the pioneering days of the British Empire, Cox & Co set up branches in India, Burma and Egypt. Richard Cox, genuinely devoted to the welfare of the regiments he represented, was also a patron of the arts, and a friend of many of the best actors and musicians in the West End.\n\nThe architecture and structure of the building complement the master strategy originally laid down by John Nash for his Regent Street urban plan 100 years earlier.\n\nSofitel has developed the site in collaboration with The Crown Estate, Westminster City Council and MWB, to create a hotel, which reflects both the original grandeur of the building and the outstanding architecture in this prime St James location.\n\nThe architects behind Sofitel London St James are award-winning RHWL, whose reputation lies in redeveloping and refurbishing many listed buildings in visually sensitive and historic locations. RHWL's previous projects include some of the UK's most notable structures such as Sadler's Wells Theatre and The Criterion in London, Botleys Park in Surrey and Bridgewater Hall in Manchester.
